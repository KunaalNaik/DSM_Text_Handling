B00FB2XNCE,3,67,81,"October 3, 2013",AA7CHSYLJOSY4,Blu Tooth Issues resolved - Updated,"Bought this device as second Android screen for my Samsung Galaxy S4 smart phone. Got with the black strap. So far it is working ok. There were some initial troubles in pairing this device with my phone via NFC. After several attempts, gave up on NFC pairing and went with blu tooth pairing. Blu tooth pairing is holding good till now. I have moved this watch away from the phone by significant distance and did not face any re-pairing type annoyances yet.The watch face is wider than the length by few mm. I went with this watch instead of Samsung gear because I have small hands and I thought this will fit better than Samsung gear. The Gear is longer and narrower than Sony SW2. This watch sits perfect on my hand with no constant sliding in any direction. I have to use the last hole on the strap though.I did not go with Samsung Gear because, as of now it will not work with my S4. I was also not keen on camera, extra cost and non-replaceable straps.The resolution on SW2 is decent, but Samsung Gear resolution is much better. I did not compare them side by side, but I am fine with Sony SW2 resolution. I purchased one app so far to enable me to dial numbers from the phone (just for coolness factor).The SW2 has one button on the side (like a regular watch) and it has 3 soft buttons (back, home and apps type button - still trying to figure this one out). You cannot press the soft buttons directly without pressing side button first. One the other side, there is a micro usb port to charge the watch.Sony SW2 Smart Connect Liveware is the software that need to be installed on the phone first. It happens when the watch is paired with phone. One can also download the s/w from google play store directly as well. Once the Liveware s/w is installed the watch comes to life. The liveware s/w gives options to installs apps on the watch directly. There are few to select from.The screen response is decent. It is not blazing fast, but generally responsive. I have installed Gmail, Messages, phone app, dial pad so far. They all work fine. The gmail app shows the gmail on your watch, messages shows texts on watch on so on. The dialpad allowed me to dial a number from the watch.My biggest complaint about this watch is its standby brightness. It is very low and it is difficult to read the time without pushing the side button. The black watch face (shown in some pictures) is absolutely not readable. I have switched to white background, which made it marginally better. Pushing the side button, brightens up the screen and makes the time very readable.  I think this is a big miss for Sony SW2. The watch should always tell time clearly without the need to push additional buttons. Hopefully this will get fixed via s/w update in near future.My second issue is that there are no apps to allow multiple timezones to be displayed on the watch. As a watch linked to smartphone, I think this should have been made available out of the box. It should have allowed the travelers to switch timezones with a simple swipe action. This would have made it really useful for people traveling in multiple time zones regularly. I hope an app gets released by Sony or some third party to address this gap. There is a timezone app in the market, which allows to set a single timezone.I will keep testing and post any updates.Pros:- fits on my small hand- looks good- wide and flexible strap- Decent resolution- Some useful appsCons:- Standby display brightness is very low making it very difficult to tell time without pushing the side button- Cannot pair via NFC (may be it is a galaxy s4 issue)- Very few free apps. Most of the apps are at least 0.99- No hotmail app- Mail app listed by liveware is not compatible with the watch- No world clock app yet- Watch froze once so far, Had to reset (by pushing and holding power button for 15 second)Update : 10/4/2013The device is always paired over blu tooth. As some else pointed out, NFC is just for easier pairing. I think the issue was, when I tried pair it by NFC tapping, it did not download the liveware software. However when I paired it using blu tooth manually, it started downloading liveware software. I stand corrected on the NFC pairing. Thanks for pointing it out. However, theI am downgrading it 1 star because this device impacts the call quality on my blu tooth paired car phone system (honda odyssey). When this device is paired, the phone calls have become scratchy, barely audible over the other blu tooth paired headset.Update : 10/11/2013The blue tooth issue has been resolved after taking to an android expert. Basically on the phone I have to turn off sending Media Audio over BT, but only send Call Audio over BT. This resolved the call quality issues I had with Odyssey Handsfree Link BT.",

B00FB2XNCE,5,2,2,"August 6, 2014",AP6ZSZ5M3Z647,I am extremely glad I purchased it,"I won't repeat all the glowing reviews others have posted.  This watch does everything I expected it to and has never failed me once.  I am extremely glad I purchased it.The one thing I wasn't expecting was to be a pseudo-salesman for Sony by answering all the questions and showing off all the features of the watch !  Not a day goes by without someone asking me &#34;Is that one of those smart watches ?&#34; and I have to flip through screens, show text messages I received, etc..  Get a text and look at your wrist without touching your phone and you get, &#34;Did you just read that text on your WATCH ?!?&#34;  Your phone rings, you look at your wrist and say, &#34;That's going to voicemail.&#34;. Onlookers just say &#34;W-What ??&#34;.If you're shy or don't like talking to people, do NOT get this watch !",

B00FB2XNCE,1,2,4,"May 4, 2014",A1ZZCRNVVTH1XG,Get the galaxy gear instead.,Battery life is awful and you can not receive call or should I say talk on it like the galaxy gear. Waste of money.,
B00FB2XNCE,5,2,2,"May 2, 2014",A37XAN43KC3VL,Awesome new toy.,"Great price first of all....this watch is an awesome new toy if you like watches and technology. So many little neat useless things you can do on this baby, plus it also tells time. Takes a little while to get used to. I think one of the coolest things about this is setting the alarm, waking up to your wrist vibrating is a heck of a lot better than some annoying alarm clock. A lot cheaper than the Samsung Gear, sure the smartwatch 2 doesn't have a camera or a speaker but do you really need to take pictures from your wrist or have the world hearing your phone conversation? No. Plus it looks a little Dick Tracy talking into your wrist, like do you think you're secret service?Smartwatch 2 - go for it!Very impressed.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,0,1,"May 1, 2014",A3J16WMKU4QCSA,Great for reading notifications and SMS messages!,"The smartwatch is a device that few people really *need*, though it's really nice to have.I use this little guy to read my phone's notifications, check the weather, change songs on the phone's player, and read emails and text messages as they come in. It is perfect for that.It is priced very well for what it does.Why 4 stars? I am a sucker for high-res screens these days, and I'm sorry Sony -- you made a really readable display in a water resistent package, but those pixels drop one star. I'm a brat. I'm spoiled by post-2012 LCD screens on my doo-hickeys, and while your colors and contrasts are great, those darn pixels stand out like low-tech featurephone screens of yesteryear.I still love it. It's stylish, the battery lasts me 5-6 days, and I don't have to take it off in the shower! (though I probably should)",
B00FB2XNCE,3,0,1,"April 29, 2014",A1VGLLMR1YH9UA,Ok smartwatch,"This is an ok smartwatch. It does its job, but does not wow me. There was an update that improved some but it was not enough. I do like the you can switch the watch bands out.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,1,3,"April 28, 2014",A2JLMLR04TA4Y0,"Not what I expected, but everything it claims to be.","I got this watch mainly because I was so impressed by the Sony Xperia Z Ultra that I wanted to see other products in the line.I find this watch basically useless:  the screen is too small to interact with  the screen is too small to read emailsHowever, I'm giving it five stars as it fulfills its description / specs.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,1,1,"April 28, 2014",A2LNJJWW2TLL00,Good for the price,Received my Sony Smart Watch2. I'm extremely please on its operations one week into it. Very easy setup. The hardest part was getting the watch out of the box it comes it. Looks to holding a charge good so far.  More to follow..,
B00FB2XNCE,5,5,5,"April 28, 2014",A2X3KDSA8NPFRZ,The Sony SW2 is far more than what I had originally expected,"My decision on purchasing a Smartwatch came after I decided that I was tired of replacing batteries or face crystals and/or wristbands each time a watch battery would die. It's funny that you don't realize how difficult it is to get inside some watches until you have to.I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note II, and was originally set on getting the latest Samsung Galaxy Gear. But after noticing the subtle differences between the Gear and the SW2...&#8226; SW2 weighs less&#8226; SW2 has an interchangeable wristband&#8226; SW2 is water resistant for (showering, washing hands, light/med exposure to fresh water)&#8226; SW2 is easy to read in direct sunlight (even in low-power mode)&#8226; SW2 synchronizes w/any Android BlueTooth and/or NFC device running Android 4.2 or greater&#8226; SW2 is under $150 (when purchased thru Amazon)&#8226; SW2 has a nice selection of Apps from the Play Market&#8226; SW2 running only the stock software v1.4.51 has improved my battery life to 7 days (normal use) w/out a recharge&#8226; SW2 uses any standard micro USB for recharging... so with that said, the decision was easy.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,2,3,"April 27, 2014",A2PSC7LUNIDEAH,APRIL UPDATE allows you to change background wallpaper.,"I was torn between this and Galaxy 2, but not anymore.  Not only is Sony much cheaper and suits me better, but as of April, 2014, you can now change the wallpaper, similar to Galaxy 2 watches.  Overall I think this smartwatch is better suitable for me than Galaxy 2 and here is why:Battery lasts longer:  Two plus days of moderate use and it still keeps on ticking.  Charging it everyday would make it feel like another device rather than a watch.  I wasn't a fan of wearing a watch, but I am now.Charging:  To charge this, simply connect it to any USB-powered outlet or computer.  Galaxy 2 offers a complicated dongle and because I'll have to charge it more often, it would become a hassle.Less is more:  I realize that with Galaxy 2 I can take pictures and use it as a speakerphone, but do I need that?  First off, taking a picture with your watch will make you look downright creepy at times and I'm sure with time, more public places will notice and restrict the use of it(like gym.)  While talking through a watch might be handy at some point, do I really need to look like a Power Ranger on a street?Thinner:  Sony is thinner by design and as I've mentioned before, it was important for me to have a swartwatch that resembles a more traditional discreet watch rather than a &#34;look at me I'm a futuristic device watch.&#34;Cheaper:  If you get the right deal, this watch can cost you almost two times less than Galaxy 2 and because I do not eat caviar for breakfast nor own a diamond-studded swimming pool, this is important to me as well.Please note that I am not putting Galaxy 2 down.  I'm a fan of both brands.  I own a Galaxy phone and a tablet, which is why I was so torn, but Sony2 suited my lifestyle better.  Both devices are great and it all depends what you need a smartwatch for that should be the deciding factor.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,0,1,"April 24, 2014",A324N2OPC7E1LW,Watch out!,"Very cool!  Lots of cool apps.  Wish you could talk in your watch, but it is good to know when a call comes through and you may miss it cause it is in your purse.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,3,3,"April 23, 2014",A2T7HX60WDRGIF,Not quite what it could be,"I bought this watch after doing some research on the various smartwatchs available and I have been pretty happy with it. My main reason for having it is because I am not allowed to have my phone out at work but with this I can keep up with any text messages, facebook posts, and see if and who is calling when my phone is on silent.Pros:  -Takes a standard micro USB to charge not a cumbersome cradle.  - Is compatible with all android phones unlike samsungs smartgear.  - This watch gives you the option to change the wrist band, I have already changed it out to a steel band.  - gives a great quick view of alerts from your cell phone  - Recent update allows you to adjust the watch face to your liking  - Great price, not even a $10,000 Rolex can do half of the stuff this can doCons:  - Should have the option to show the weather on the watch face without 3rd party apps  - Having too many apps on the device slows it down and causes it to constantly drop connection  - battery is only good for maybe two days, but should be charged every night to be sure.  - Should have a clear all function for the alertsI am looking forward to the new line of android watches being developed with the new Google now OS but for now due to the price and compatibility I find this one to be top dog.",
B00FB2XNCE,1,0,1,"July 17, 2014",A66KX1LPPZ2LF,Fail,"I initially was pleased with the product, then it just quit working - won't even power on or charge. I guess I'll learn now how well the product warranty service is, less than a month after purchase.",

It showed up with the wrist straps taken apart, the screen protector peeled off and stuck to the manual, and missing the cord. If I pay full price for something new, I expect it to actually be new. I plugged it in with my own cord before sending it back to see if it even worked. It did but the screen resolution sucked, and connecting with your smartphone was clunky and a hassle. Do yourself a favor and find a different smartwatch.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,0,1,"July 16, 2014",A3NZVD3WHNKYCK,Four Stars,Short battery life.,
B00FB2XNCE,5,2,2,"July 16, 2014",AZOK5STV85FBJ,"Not Galaxy Gear, but that was not what I was going for.","I used this watch for about 4 months now to give it a real world evaluation.-Pros  - light and unobtrusive  - battery lasts for a few days  - customizable  - easy to charge with a micro usb-Cons  - People will keep asking why you didnt get a galaxy gear  - not the best in direct sunlightI bought this item for a few simple reasons. I needed a way to see if I was missing a call or message while on motorcycle/ loud car such as a convertible. It works very well for that. Feel the vibration, look down and see the type of alert. If I have my phone in my pocket, i set it to silent, and then am able to reject calls if I am in a meeting without even taking my phone from my pocket.Sony has released two updates since I have owned this watch. First update allowed me to create my own watch face layouts as well as other tweaks. Second update within the last week now allows me to set my own image as the background.I started out getting all alerts sent to my watch, but I am now down to only Gmail, text messages, and phone calls. You can respond to texts, but only from pre-set responses and you can pre-create your own. Helpful for the motorcycle when i can just tap &#34;on my way&#34; or &#34;sorry, i am currently riding my motorcycle and will call you later&#34;.It does not have a built in camera, but does allow remote viewing of your phone camera. Resolution isnt too high, but it does allow for remotely taken group pics with you in them. I use it at work to see network port numbers in really hard to see areas.I compared it to my cousins galaxy gear watch, and his clearly wins, I could buy over two of these for what he paid vs what I paid. He was shocked that mine could just charge off of the same charger the phone uses, his needs a special device.  If you are looking for a do it all gadget to shove in peoples faces, get the galaxy gear, if you want a sensible watch that happens to have apps, alerts you to notifications, and still has people coming up to you asking &#34;Omg, is that one of those smart watches?!&#34; for half the price of the other one, get the Sony.",

He is quite impressed with the Smart Watch and it's abilities as well as it's sleek looks.  However, the one drawback that must be noted is that the watch strap has disconnected from the watch atleast 4 times in the past month.  There appears to be a flaw in the construction and unless the wearer is aware that the small peg has become disconnected, he or she will find no Smart Watch on their wrist!!  Other than this, my husband seems pleased with his Sony Smart Watch 2 and recommends it.",
B00FB2XNCE,1,6,9,"January 19, 2014",A2CLQF21DDMFOD,only worked for 11 days,"I love this thing when I got it , of course I had to get every app out for it spent maybe $30 on the paid apps even ordered bracelet for it as well. The watch was above my explications when I ordered  The Facebook updates were great , could see who was calling very cool aps love this watch. The one thing I notice was the charging port was very cheaply made , you had to push it into the watch and  knew over time it could be a problem. It also cable with no charging cable by he way. The watch was really cool  was very happy  11 days later just stopped working wouldn't charge anymore . I got a second cable nothing the thing was dead. Its like the other guy said in his review  your watch last over 10 days I would be  surprised, its a lot of money to spend on a paper weight. The company I ordered it from was very nice and gave me a full refund. I will not be buying this ever again or any thing with the Sony name on  . very disappointed with this cheaply made Sony product. Sony sucks!!!",

Only really used it a few hours.The pro's are:Nice to have a visual on who is calling without fishing your phone out of your pocket.You can dial from your wrist using either the dial pad (separate app of course) or using your contacts.Alarms and notes at your wrist.Cons:If you don't have a Sony you need to use a 3rd party app to get email. The app is decent enough, but I would prefer it work with the default Android apps.Pretty long pauses between getting a text or hangout message and a prompt.Some messages were just never delivered.The phone that I use is a Nexus 5.Maybe Google will program a standard reporting tool for wearable tech in the future so that you don't need 2 layers of applications to get notifications.",

Although this watch has a poor screen and somewhat chunky look, I was still fairly pleased with it until today. I found out that there was a firmware update available and used the Sony Update Service to install the update. The update completely bricked the watch. No matter what I do, I cannot get it to turn on. I spent quite a bit of time on the phone with Sony support and they could not figure it out. It will be going back for a replacement. A quick internet search reveals that this is a common problem and apparently one that is directly related to the firmware update. If you have this watch, I would avoid updating the firmware until this issue has been addressed.",

(With specificplay store names to overcome their deficiency.)In addition to normal 'phone and messaging functions, I make significant use of controllingthe Power Amp player. I have over 7K songs on my Galaxy S3 which I play through aBluetooth attached HDMX Jam speaker. Great to control via the watch. (Requires a PowerAmp addition ($1.99).",
B00FB2XNCE,4,0,0,"October 1, 2014",A2GL6ERL295ZFC,Smart Watch that does everything I want a smart watch to do NOW for BARGAIN Price,"I bought the Sony Smart Watch 2 (SW2) used.  I have every kind of gadgets and I wanted something new to play with.  Well, I bought the SW2 for the value and flexibility over the Samsung Galaxy Gear because it works only for certain Samsung smartphones.  Sony SW2 works with any android smartphone which is a big plus for me as I like to change phones often.As for the hardware, I really like it.  Very light and durable. (Dropped few time on tile floor) It's water resistant and has replaceable standard 24mm wrist strap.  It has again standard micro USB which is a HUGE plus for me as I hate to mess with another dedicated special cable or charging dock.  The battery life is very good and should last you several days without any problem once the &#34;new&#34;ness disappears and you don't constantly play with it.  The display is on all the time to function as a watch which is another big plus.  It's without back light to save battery.  You can double tap to turn on the backlight to get time in the dark, but you have to push the side button to use the &#34;smart&#34; watch features and check notifications. (Notification do flash the info when you get them.) The watch itself doesn't have mic or camera.  That's ok as I would use my phone with LG Tone for mic.  Camera isn't really necessary and it will be more of a gimmick.  NFC works well to connect and bluetooth connection with the phone is very good and stable with good range.Software is very good.  The Sony base software to communicate with the SW2 is good and stable. I love that you can customize the watch face to your heart's content.  It's so flexible with so many possible options is various information you can set up to view on the watch face or have widgets. (Info is great but widgets are pretty useless.  They are not very responsive to be useful and you still have to push the button on the side to use them.)  Now for the additional softwares.  The addition for facebook and gmail works well enough.  It even has  Kakao Talk addition to get the notification which but good surprise.  So I get all the useful notifications I need. (yes it has instagram, twitter, and few other popular social app notification additions you can download for free.)  So notification is good enough in my opinion.There are many 3rd Party Apps.  There are several &#34;cool&#34; apps that I can use and show off with.  Still, cool apps are slow as the processing power of the SW2 wasn't meant to run complex apps.  Remote camera lags drastically to make it all but unusable for example.  I do like the music remote and toggle apps where I can use it to run my music with LG Tone.  Now I have a display for selecting music.  I also can turn on and off my wifi tethering without taking my phone out when I use my tablet when I am out.  I also use the find my phone app now and then.Improvements:  This is HUGE.  I WISH I CAN CONTROL THE VIBRATION INTENSITY.  It's TOO LOUD and STRONG.  It feels like it's going to break the watch as it shakes it so violently.  I don't understand why you can't.  Now, these are minor &#34;wants&#34;.  I want to my SW2 to hold music independently and connect to LG tone when I am not connected to my phone via Bluetooth to use it when I work out.  I want the SW2 to be faster with those &#34;cool&#34; apps without sacrificing battery life.Conclusion:  I don't &#34;need&#34; a Smart Watch when I have a Smart Phone.  Still, if I am going to have a watch anyways, I want that watch to be cool~ SW2 is a cool watch and a cool toy to play with.  I like it, but I know Smart Watches are going to improve in short time.  I currently does almost everything I want a &#34;smart&#34; watch to do, so I got it for a very cheap price. (Price of a normal watch)  I know better smart watches are coming out.  Still, I wouldn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a smart watch that does what SW2 does better.  I rather spend that money on a new tablet or other cool gadgets, not a watch that &#34;displays&#34; information like time, notifications, schedule, and weather, and act as a remote for your phone that is most likely in your pocket...",

B00FB2XNCE,5,1,1,"February 27, 2014",A1GK0VRWY7I3D1,Smart-watch 2 review,"The reason I chose 5 stars for the sony smart watch 2 is because it is a superior watch over it's older brother the smart watch 1.  Yes, I did indeed buy both the smart watch 1 and I own and use now the smart watch 2.  Why do I like the smw2?Design:  The design for it is really nice, the screen is nice and clean and the wrist straps can be changed out to any strap that is aviable for its size. I believe the wrist strap has to be either 22 or 24.  I personally use the one that came with it, but plan on buying a Black/gold strap later.  The 3 buttons are ok, they bring me back to an old galaxy phone, but still it's nice to have. The watch itself is light and the battery charger is covered. My only problem with the power button, and this is only a problem because I do what I do is, I stretch everyday before I start work and bringing my left hand back (my watch hand) I accidentally turn off my watch.  It's a mall issue because the watch powers on in like 3seconds.Battery:  This time around versus the smw1 the smw2 is 200% better.  I go days between charging, at least 5-6 days with light use and 3-4 days with moderate.Apps: This is where the smw2 shines.  Through my apps on the smw2 I am able to text friends back through my watch, check my battery life, find my phone, take pictures from my watch but using my phones camera, view emails/texts, photo galleries, take notes, calendar, calculator, weather, music, alarm, flashlight, running app, gps, oh and tell time!.note: If you plan on texting from your watch, keep in mind that you can only send messages that you set up in your phone. The good news is that you can set up a lot. I myself have set up a text for each instance that I would use normally.yes, no, love you, ill get back to you, etc.Display: ok, here is where most have problems. Are the images on your watch HD, heck no! no where near them.  Are they viewable yes.  Are you going to impress people? heck yes!.  I check my time constantly and people go crazy as to what is up with my &#34;back to the future&#34; time piece. The display is good for what it is.  Its color screen which was the selling point for me to buy over the pebble which was approximately the same price, give or take.Conclusion: If you are thinking of buying this or the smw1 buy this trust me you will not be disappointed",

Only thing that's bothering me is that the watch does a factory reset by its own sometimes and I lose the alarms I had and the favorite apps ORDER, but at least I do not lose any configurations since it's all controled via the phone.I totally recommend it if you're looking for a SW for android. I have an S3 and I got this over the Gear.--EDIT--TODAY, AFTER TWO MONTHS AND A COUPLE OF DAYS, THE WATCH CAME OFF THE FRAME. I will put up a picture to explain. Sadly I called Sony Mobile Support and they told me all I could do was ship it back and get a replacement. Of course the best thing is I HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPPING.

B00FB2XNCE,5,46,50,"February 18, 2014",A3SS042FJQJN39,A smart decision.,"I purchased this watch because I was tired of waiting for another smart watch whose name will not be mentioned. Anyway: This watch is fine so far (I just received it tonight).Setup was a bit of a pain. *Before you set up the watch be sure to download these two applications: 'Smart Connect' and 'Smartwatch 2'.*If you're using NFC pairing then lay your watch flat on its face then slide the back of your phone against the back of the watch until you either hear or feel the watch vibrate. Keep the phone close to the watch and it will load up.Once the setup is complete you're free to go to the Smart Connect application and download applications that come with the phone. Whilst downloading one application, scroll down to see other recommended applications. I'm glad that this watch has been released for some time now because when it first came out, the applications I downloaded (like Spotify) weren't available.Pros:Lightweight.Is comfortable on my wrist.Easy to swipe from screen to screen.Brightness - My brightness is dimmed down quite a lot (less than 25%) and the screen is still clearly visible.Infinite possibilities with application creation.Price - Way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy Gear (almost half the cost).ConsSetup process - See above.Messages - The messages read individually as if on an old flip phone; the messages are not grouped together. Not that big of an issue, but still worth mentioning.Watch faces - Not many watch faces are offered, but I found one that I like nevertheless.'Limited colors' - I put this in quotes and under cons because while you can change out the wristband, I've read reviews stating that if you do it voids the warranty.If you were deciding between this item (Smartwatch 2) or the Samsung Galaxy Gear then choose this.Will continually update as the time moves on.------------------------------------------------Update 23/2/14: Charge appears to hold for three days. Uses include checking the weather, messages, receiving calls and the occasional Facebook message. However, there is a slight problem; whilst charging/after the watch is done charging, the battery bar that is displayed is never full. Even when I first received the watch and fully charged it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 24/2/14: Problem about the charge has been remedied. If you're using a Samsung/Galaxy device, then you can simply use your phone charger to charge your watch. This has worked for me and now has my watch at 100% battery. I won't charge it again until the battery runs out to truly confirm the battery life.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 26/2/14: Charge is holding quite fine after two days of use. Battery is ever so slightly starting to go down, which means it might make it past three days and all it truly needed was a full charge via the phone charger. I've run into a 'problem' whilst trying to delete applications from the watch. I'll list the steps as best as possible-On your phone click on the application you wish to delete > Hit the home button > Hold the home button > Hold the application until the tiny menu pops up > Click 'App info' > Click 'Uninstall' > Click 'OK'.Go to your Smartwatch > Find the application you just deleted from your phone > Click on it > -Once that is done, the application should remove itself. It's easier than it appears to be; it's just a lot of steps which are quite easy, and are really small steps.The only problem is deleting pre-installed applications. This cannot be done, so be wary of what you install on your Smartwatch from the pre-installed application list when'st you first get it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/1/14Day SIX of NO CHARGE! This watch is amazing! Only problem currently is the lack of the weather application to be able to open. This could possibly (and hopefully) be due to not having a full charge or near a full charge. The battery looks to be at about 25% currently, and I do have a double today at work. The watch might just make it for seven full days with only one full charge (or even longer?). This is incredible. I'm not too sure if the watch will still work as just as a watch (being able to ONLY tell the time) when the battery dies. I suppose I'll find out.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/2/14Holy crap! DAY SEVEN!!! This morning, around 11 a.m. before I left for work, the watch vibrated and said '10%'. And guess what? It's still on and hasn't died yet and I have been using it excessively since last night and today. It's holding up just fine. I really want to reiterate: *IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BETWEEN THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2 or the GALAXY GEAR THEN GET THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2!* -It's still holding it's full charge for seven days (one week) now, even with moderate AND excessive use. This watch is truly better than the Galaxy Gear, and half the cost too! It does exactly what you'd want it to do. Notifies you of a notification, be it Facebook, text, Snapchat, Kik, etc. If you get the Galaxy Gear you have the option to reply back on the watch. Hello...the screen is so much smaller AND it's in T9 (which is where you have to type the number 1 three times if you want to get to the letter 'C'). Also, with all the reviews I read on that, I highly doubt the Galaxy Gear's charge can hold up to this.*This watch's rating is going from a 4 Star to a 5 Star. This has been truly impressive and has held up now since I got it back on the 18th of February. This will be my last edit to this review as there's not much else to say that I haven't already.---I know my review is long, but if you read the whole thing, you'll be glad you did. The review helps with daily entries of how the watch holds up!",

It's amazingly lightweight and the battery life gets me through at least 3-4 days of constant use. Sony and third party app developers have a good amount of applications for the SW2 on the Google play store for download and their Sony management software is easy to use and configure. Linking the smart watch was so simple when using the onboard NFC chip. Had it paired to my GS3 in seconds. The UI is silky smooth and the boot time is super fast, almost boots up within 5 sec. I have a friend that has the galaxy gear and when I showed him The Sony he was thoroughly impressed! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a Smart Watch.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,7,8,"November 3, 2013",AD4XKDR0MD7JO,Much Better Than First Version,"The second version improves upon some of the limitations of the first, but not all.My phone has replaced by beeper with urgent messages sent over both text and gmail. My primary need for the watch is to be able to see text and gmail messages in cases where either I might not notice my phone ringing/vibrating or when it is awkward to turn on the phone (such as in a movie theater). From that perspective, two of the biggest problems of the first version have been improved upon--the screen is much brighter so that it can be seen outside (plus is adjustable for when I want it dim in a movie theater) and the vibration is much stronger, making it unlikely I will fail to notice the vibration as with the first version. I have noticed some people complain that the vibration is  too strong so it might be beneficial if this was adjustable. I also wish I could customize the vibrations--such as have different patterns under some circumstances. I believe that there is a third party app which might do this.There are also other improvements. The screen is bigger and works quite well to read longer messages. I also use it for RSS feeds and some Facebook updates and can read a fair amount (considering it is still a watch) on it. While I haven't tested it, being more waterproof could be a plus.I prefer the controls of the newer version with menu buttons rather than the old means of tapping. It is a huge plus that, should the phone get disconnected, this still works as a watch.Getting disconnected remains a problem as with the first model. I'm finding that it actually says it has disconnected over bluetooth less often than with the first version, but this still happens. There have been several occasions in which the watch and phone say they are connected over bluetooth but it is not really transferring information and apps which need the phone stop working. I am hoping that software or firmware upgrades improve upon this communication.A minor complaint is that you can't set the order of each app as on the old version. You have a choice of alphabetical or most used. It could also use more options for clock face, at least  a digital version with time and date.Many of the software limitations continue from the first version. For example, the Facebook app is too limited in choosing what information is sent. There should be a on/off control for the entire News Feed. It also takes a long time to set up which people are included if you have a lot of Facebook friends. Newly added people are set to transfer--I would prefer the opposite unless I specifically choose to have them sent to the phone. It would also make things much easier if you can select from lists of people set up on Facebook. There's similar issues with Twitter.The high frequency of times when it is not working reliably remains the biggest problem. Sometimes turning the watch off and on and/or rebooting the phone gets them connected again. Quite often it has been necessary to repair them over bluetooth and reload everything on the watch (occurring more than once a day so far).Update: After using the smartwatch several more days,I'm upgrading it from 3 to 4 stars. I'm still having problems with it losing connections intermittently, but much less often. When they wouldn't connect at all I found that they would often reconnect if I turned off the watch, rebooted the phone, and then turned the watch on again. This is a nuisance, but not as bad as re-pairing and reinstalling everything to the watch. The last time this happened, instead of rebooting the phone, I turned bluetooth off and then on again. It worked that time and I will have to see if this works consistently.Crashes sometimes occur with adding or removing apps, so once the watch is set up as desired there is a lower risk of problems.I also found that less is more. It does seem that having more apps on the watch corresponded with more cases of the watch not responding. It is better to have fewer apps which work well as opposed to more apps and more times when it is not working right. I'm still playing around to determine to what degree it is number of apps, or whether certain apps are more likely to increase problems. Some apps are more meaningful than others. For example, it is a real convenience to have the phone give an alert when there is an alarm set for an event on the calendar. It is less important to run an app on the watch which shows the entire calendar when it isn't a big deal to pull out the phone. I also got rid of the Facebook and Twitter apps for now. For those who do want every bell and whistle installed, I also wonder if newer phones would handle the load better. (I'm using a Galaxy Nexus which is now approaching two years old).The phone is still not as reliable as it should be but has enabled me to monitor incoming messages while my phone was being recharged in a different room.Update 2: The watch has been more reliable after using it longer. I suspect that is a combination of choosing the apps which work best with it and perhaps the Android system now prioritizes the Smartwatch programs after having used them more.  I have removed 'not ready for prime time' from the original title of the post after previously increasing from three to four stars. It still loses connection from time to time, but less often. If going somewhere where it is especially important that the smartwatch provide notifications without turning on the phone, such as a movie theater, I would reboot the phone first. I also find that BlueTooth does not work as well for streaming audio as well when the Smartwatch is on. I also wonder if this has something to do with how the Android operating system is prioritizing resources.I've found the watch to also be of greater value now with programs which send notifications for multiple programs. This both reduces the number of programs you need running and provides notifications for every program you want shown on the watch regardless of whether there is a smartwatch app. For example, if your phone has notifications for Facebook and Twitter you can have these relayed to the smartwatch without having to run separate programs to monitor Facebook and Twitter. I like WatchIt! the best of programs of this type which I have tried, and it is free. Augmented Smartwatch Pro is an interesting paid app. I don't like it for replacing most notification apps as it is intended, but it does so much that even though I don't use it for notifications it still replaces several other apps such as missed call notification, battery meter, weather (but only gives weather for the current day), rain alerts, phone signal strength, and control of music apps (for pausing and starting, but without volume control).",

Battery life is less than one day and the unit also depletes the phone battery so quickly it renders both useless. I was using it with a Motorola MAXX which has a substantial 3500 mah battery. Unfortunately I also bought some apps and a metal band for it which are now worthless to me. So it goes.It's a nice looking device.

B00FB2XNCE,3,5,8,"November 1, 2013",A2ZGDRH48UBXFN,(Gear v. Smartwatch 2)  Decent watch if you really want a smart watch.,"Initially, I was was set on buying the Galaxy Gear smart watch and so I went to my local Best Buy to get one.  Fortunately, for me they did not have any in stock and said that if I wanted one I would need to wait a week or so to get one.  Nonetheless, there was a few display watches that I could play with.  I tried the Galaxy Gear on and immediately noticed the how bulky it was on my wrist.  Moreover, it wasn't as stylish in person as I had thought it to be, and it looked awkward to the point that I knew that every time someone looked at my wrist, I would have to explain what the hell the thing on my wrist was.  I don't have time like that in my day.  So the next day I saw that Sony would be releasing its new smartwatch, the Sony Smartwatch 2.  It was 100 dollars cheaper and it looked much more like a watch rather than a device on my wrist.  I also found out that it was water resistant where I could wear it in the shower and could wear it while washing dishes.  The main selling point for me on this watch was the amount of time that a charge could be held without having to recharge the watch (around 2-3 days).  Moreover, this was a third generation product, meaning that there were 2 other previous older versions of the watch that Sony could improve on, which meant they had developed more apps for the watch plus the watch would work with any Android phone running 4.0 or better so if I wanted to change phones I could do that without having to think about my watch being obsolete.  All these benefits were things that the Samsung Galaxy Gear could not provide me.  With that being said, I went into a Sony store and bought a black one with a metal band that costs 20 dollars extra. Overall, I would say that I am somewhat satisfied with the product.  Satisfied in the sense that it is a watch and its stylish, something that a watch should be.  Also, as advertised the phone holds excellent time between charges and the notifications come in pretty much on cue. And, its useful when driving when you can't check your phone, because one can also make calls from the watch, very useful when the phone is connected to the car via bluetooth.  What I don't like about the watch is that it lacks a music app so that I can run Pandora or Spotify through it, apps which I use frequently use.  Instead it gives you a generic Google music app which is very laggy and is very limited.  Additionally, occasionally the watch freezes up and when its functional the watch frequently doesn't respond to swipes making you swipe numerous times for the watch to function.  Further, the bluetooth range is limited to about 25-30 feet max.  So if you live in a bigger home then expect your watch to drop in and out of connection frequently.  It also can't answer calls on your phone from the watch unless you have a bluetooth head set or a Sony smartphone, which kind of annoyed me.  Overall, as a watch the Smartwatch is still expensive, but when compared to the Galaxy Gear, is a more practical and functional device.  I didn't need a video camera/camera on my watch unless I: 1. needed to cheat on a test 2. do something perverted with it.  Additionally I didn't want to look stupid answering my phone from my wrist and talking to my wrist.  So I believe I made the right choice between the two.  But, unless you really want a smart watch I would advise you to wait for Apple or Google to take a shot at it so you can make a better decision, because the smart watch market is limited as of now.",

The watch 'guts' came apart/unglued from the metallic housing basically plopping itself on the floor. Looking at how it is put together, I can see that the glue holding the main part of the watch to the aluminum housing is very weak. I don't see how this watch can last any more than a couple of weeks. You can easily push the watch guts out of the outer aluminum holder by simply flipping the watch upside down exposing the back. Push the middle of the watch against the outer housing. I guarantee you that you can push it out with minimal effort. It is only a matter of time before the watch just detaches itself from the housing. I was really disappointed as I really liked the look of the watch and generally liked it.Update 11/24/13:Many other customers reporting the same issue.

Kha's previous review except for a small observation particular to the Samsung Galaxy II: Make sure you upgrade to Android 4.1 or better (4.0 kept restarting the Sony software). Then follow the directions from Samsung including pairing through SmartConnect (and not the normal direct bluetooth pairing). After that it is truly smooth sailing. Kudo's to Sony for listening to SW1 customers.I don't really care for a Dick Tracy watch because I don't want to be talking to my wrist. I'd rather talk thriough an eye-glasses set, an earset, or even a digital bulletproof T-Shirt phone accessory (powered by body heat ad no I haven't seen one yet :P) - I am just throwing an idea  out there - OK, back to the matter: Yeah, the web browser is incredible at my first use. I have ideas for that. So I am going to give it 5 stars because it will get me to where I want. Also I want to encourage Sony to exceed my expectations in future software/firmware upgrades.One of the great things is, you do not have to buy a new phone, however, when it is time to upgrade I am thinking seriously about the Sony Xperia",

Tried the Galaxy Gear boring and ugly! The Sony SW2 is definitely worth the money spent! Works great, endless apps so far and readable unlike the Pebble Steel in which you could barely see. The light on this watch is amazing, camera app, music app, picture slideshow app, all work perfect with my LG G2! I'm sure it will drain on my battery, but so will All Bluetooth connected devices! The notifications are working perfectly, absolutely no complaints so far! Very comfortable on my wrist and doesn't look big for a woman!

B00FB2XNCE,3,1,3,"March 16, 2014",A3Q7Q6QDA0WLMU,Over priced if you ask me,But then again I think all smart watches are too much. If your bad about bangging your watch against everything don't buy you will break. I think for what you pay for this watch its weak on what it does. Come on for what you pay for this watch it really doesn't do anything too well except tell time. Its my first smart watch and probably will be my last until they get a lot better. It is very light but kinda plain and too square yes I knew what it looked like but I overlooked the looks thinking that I was going to get a lot more than just a watch. I did not. I do not recommend not for the price maybe if it was 50 bucks maybe I would recommend just maybe. You have to pay for most of the apps that really doesn't work very well at all. The apps that are free are crap at least most of them. I am not very satisfied with this watch at all but I'm sure by reading this review you already know that.,

B00FB2XNCE,3,2,2,"March 11, 2014",A2NGI5WSNS1CMW,Decent watch,"Got this to alert me of messages and calls to which i cannot hear because of noisy environment.  It work with Android phones, i paired with Samsung S4 and LG2 with no problem. Mine came with black plastic band. One thing i noticed is that if you have BT HandsFreeLink in your vehicle that  connects to your phone, you need to turn watch off otherwise all you hear is static and garble through your vehicle system.  Overall, because it cannot answer phone nor reply MSG i give it a 3 stars. It is decent but i feel it cost too much for its limited function. Apps are limited for this watch. Btw the apps are installed on your phone, so storage space on your phone should be considered. I get plenty of compliments from it. I wish it could have more/extended range because i usually dont want to strap my phone with me when im working.  Another thing is that it is hard to discern whether watch is connected or disconnected. It should have icon to indicate it otherwise when you try to use its function and it wont work then you know its not connected...bummer.

It looks sharp and I've had many people comment and inquire about it.  The only thing that could make it better in my eyes, was if more watch faces were available natively.  There are watch face add-on programs but they don't run on the watch and since the phone and watch have to communicate every minute to update the screen, these add-on watch faces use a lot of battery, so they aren't desirable for continued use.With the latest firmware update, which was installed by the latest Sony &#34;Smartwatch 2&#34; app that was installed on my phone, it added a couple of other faces but none that I use.  My dream upgrade would include an old-school 80's/90's style digital watch face.  Let's see if Sony is up to the task.",

Battery life is pretty good. 3-4 days is right. Pebble is more, but pebble is also more of a pain to charge because you need to have that special clip with you. SW2 charges fast and it doesn't really matter when or where it dies cause everyone has micro usb chargers nearby, but I only have one pebble charger I need to remember to either keep at work or at home.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,0,1,"February 18, 2014",A1GOY4M9TQ3XZ6,love the watch,Everything I expected. I would highly recommend this watch over the pebble. Not over the Galaxy gear . But definitely over the pebble,
B00FB2XNCE,4,2,2,"February 17, 2014",A12OPISTRBMJ81,Best Smart Watch Thus Far,"This is a pretty new field here, so I've got high hopes for the future. Also, I saw a LOT of smartwatches at CES this year, so I think this is the Year of the Smartwatch. Just to do some comparing here in comparison to a few popular models:Pebble vs Sony SW2: Sony's got the color screen, a bigger screen, a touch sensitive screen.Galaxy Gear vs Sony SW2: Sony's got compatibility. Yes, I have a Samsung phone, but that doesn't mean I'm going to when my contract is up. Sony SW2 is compatible with pretty much any Android phone that hasn't been hopelessly mutated by the manufacturer (and Samsung and HTC really push the envelope on that one).Here's what I like about it:1. Screen size is good, resolution is fine for reading text and a casual glance at an SMS pic2. Touch response is great3. Navigation via &#34;android&#34; buttons on bottom of screen is great and familiar to anyone who's familiar with stock Android.4. Takes standard watch straps. I replaced mine the next day with a nice leather strap.5. Native audio controls work great, but could use some alterations.6. Most native apps work great.7. Waterproof (IP57 rating, which is pretty good for a complex electronic)8. NFC pairing is simple and worked great.Here's what I Don't like:1. Native facebook extension app doesn't appear to function properly on the SPH-L710, not sure of issue. Partially resolved by using a generic notification app.2. no native non-Gmail email apps unless you're using a Sony phone (resolved by using a generic notification app). For example, I wanted notifications for my work MS Exchange email.Only two downsides. I think this is the best CURRENT Smartwatch. I expect to see more features coming up, as smartwatches were a &#34;thing&#34; at CES 2014, so everyone and their mother will be pushing into this territory soon, but that also means more generic apps to interact with smartwatches in general. Good job on this watch, Sony.5",

B00FB2XNCE,2,9,12,"February 14, 2014",A2OADM2SJZKY0K,"Thought I needed more, turns out basic will do","I looked at the galaxy gear and couldn't convince myself I wanted or needed it. But as a gadget girl, I persisted in finding a reason to need the technology even if it wasn't the galaxy gear. I googled high and low, read CNET and Amazon reviews ad nauseum, watched You Tube videos and narrowed it down to the Sony smart watch 2. What turned me on to try out the smart watch was the greater app availability, greater water resistance, and compatibility with multiple devices. But after trying it out for a week, I realized I didn't really use all the apps I added (about 12), I rarely would have it in a major water-risk situation, and I've had a galaxy phone for several iterations now. So once all those key metrics were blown away, all I was really left with was an unattractive digital watch. I found myself wishing I could quickly snap pictures without pulling out my phone and take quick calls. Soon the galaxy gear was calling my name again. So I returned the smart watch and got the gear. Wow what a difference. (Read my upcoming review of the Gear).So in conclusion, it's not terrible, but it just didn't wow me. The interface was a little awkward to maneuver and it just didn't handle the basics well. Yes it is cheaper than the gear, but if you're the type of person who gets geeked over technology, the extra bucks to get more will in the long run make you a happier technology-lover aka nerd. IMHO.

Sometime the unit froze up on me, or there was an unreasonable delay in getting an application to work.  The free running app upgrade that it came with didn't work at all.  The facebook application had limited functionality.  Worst of all, the only music app that you can control is the build-in app on your phone, which is great if you have all your music on your phone (I don't - I use Pandora).  There is not enough support for aftermarket apps.  Perhaps it will get better with time.  It's just too early in the development of this technology to be worth spending $200 on.",

My days are busy with frequent back-to-back meetings, instant messages from colleagues and family, e-mail, etc. etc. My goal was to see at a glance: time, date with day of the week, weather outside (should I go for a walk while I have time or stay inside?), upcoming meeting, events/notifications - I did not want to be late for meetings and I wanted to know if there were any IMs or alerts to take care of them quickly. I got this &#34;watch&#34; and can do all of the things I wanted. I discovered that I am now using my phone much less and the watch much more. Helps me keep the phone with me since the &#34;watch&#34; buzzes if I walk too far away from the phone. I am using just the Sony standard apps and they work fine. Some apps were an unexpected plus - like a flash light.Plan on replacing the watch band - the plastic band will cause the skin underneath to become sweaty. Personally, I always replace watch bands since I prefer ceramic bands so not a big deal. Feels like Sony made the right decision - I would hate to pay more because of a better band which I would discard anyway.Annoyances (causing 4 instead of 5 stars): Biggest complaint - the screen does not stay on long enough for me to read through all the information displayed on the &#34;watch&#34; face (because I also have the latest alert/event and upcoming appointment) so I have to keep pressing the stud to get the screen to light up again. There's no way to switch back to &#34;watch&#34; face from the home screen - have to press the stud to turn the watch screen off and then press it again to see the &#34;watch&#34; face. Second biggest complaint: Can't get the &#34;watch&#34; phone application to use contacts from the phone - the &#34;watch&#34; freezes - this is annoying but not too much since I generally use the phone directly (so will patiently wait for Sony to fix their bugs).",

I had noticed it was hard for me to sometimes wake up with my phone or the phone would die where this Sony watch was fantastic with battery life of 5 days. Nowadays, phones die quickly where this is the future to have those replaced. Sony did a wonderful job of this watch and literally was great had everything GPS, Light, Text Messaging, Music, Alarm, Calculator, Remote TV, etc. literally the best device I had.Here is the miserable part it died in my sleep I woke up at 6 am and would not turn on. The night before I had seen it was 3/4 full so, I went to work and left it on charge expecting by the time I came back everything would be okay like an iPod. Sad to say did not turn on or vibrate. Back track earlier on within the week the part that comes out to plug in the charger had come off so I manually put the piece back could be some damages. I will be looking at the 3rd Gen that Sony come outs with. Overall get the watch but, expect to have 2 within the course of 8-9 months.

I finally though about returning the smartwatch, but tried on more thing.  I loaded the Sony smart connect app on my Panduit tablet and turned on my Bluetooth.  The smartwatch loaded and started to work.  I deleted everything from my tablet and loaded everything on my LG phone and it appears to work, although it still has some problems.  I just downloaded an update for the smart connect app that appears to have solved some of my problems.",

Now when someone calls I see there face, and justlby pressing it i stop the call and send a prewritten text that says hey I'm working I'll call ya on break. I got a blackmetal band 24mm for 13$ and a epic leather one from a,fossil watch outlet for $4.50 . It's just so darn classy looking. 22mm leather bands look fine but 24mm is perfect fit. I got a screen protector because,being a homedepot cashier I rub against concrete and lumber. It's held up great. W. Metal band looks much classier than the pebble steel which has uneven bezil. Batterylife rules. 20 min to charge, charge last 4 days. It does everything I want it to do. It's the best smartwatch. Most realistic and well rounded. It has t-9 texting if ya wanna text. Great screen. Always impresses. Get at least 2 compliments a day sometimes more.. if buying get ready for compliments. Screen rules. Has calculated which rules, has flashlight app which comes in handy. If phones lost press app on watch and it makes noise, it rules. If you leave phone watch will vibrate so you noyou left it at house or work or car, that feature is helpfull everyday, as are the others",
B00FB2XNCE,5,0,0,"April 9, 2014",A1FXA2L044GI8C,I like this product,The package came in properly packaged. It is and does exactly as the detailed description said it would. I have been enjoying the product and look forward to buying more items in the future.,
B00FB2XNCE,3,2,2,"April 8, 2014",A2V1KTMF908HQ4,Excellent Even If You Are Not A Geek,"Ok, I am going to start with something about myself. I am not really into the latest or greatest but I do like technology specially if it makes my life easier. So my reason for purchasing the watch is due to safety measures at my workplace. We are not allowed to pull our phones during the middle of our shifts, I known people who been fired at the spot for doing so. I been eyeing a smartwatch for sometime already, but I considered the prices for the smartwatches a bit high for my liking. But since the smartwatches have been gaining more momentum in the past year, there have been more manufactures bringing their cards to the table, so pricing has fallen. I was considering the following smartwatches: Pebble Steel, Qualcom Toq, Samsung Galaxy Gear and the Sony SmartWatch 2. A the end I decided to go with the Sony SmartWatch 2.I would like to say that smartwatches aren't for everyone. If your are a person who has the phone glued to your hand then definitely the smartwatch isn't for you. At this point, smartwathces work as an extension of your phone like a bluetooth ear piece. At first it may look silly but at the end people who really needed, will appreciate the functions of the watch. For example, in my case, like I stated before I am a person who can't have the phone glued to my hand do to safety in our workplace, plus it is a loud environment. So the only time I now I get a notification is only when my phone vibrates. Like I stated before the smartwatch is a extension of your phone, you can receive notifications, control music and have some level of control on some apps. My main use is to have notifications for incoming calls and text messages, but I can get notifications for email, scores and pretty much any other notification I would like. Also I like to control music with the smartwatch, I like using PowerAmp and it has its own app to control music from the watch.To set up the watch is pretty simple. You can do it both with NFC or bluetooth. Once is paired with the phone is going to ask you to download the necessary apps to operate the watch. After all is set up is just up to you what apps you want. But here is the reason why I dropped one star for my review. Like I stated pairing is simple but when I first tried to pair my phone it gave me an error. First I thought I did something wrong so I decided to uninstall everything, reset the watch and restarted from scratch and still same error. So I decided to try to pair it with my wife's phone and to my surprise it did with out any flaws. I did some research on the web and found that some people solve the issue by factory resetting their phones. For me a reset is nothing since I am used to resetting my phone do to flashing custom software to it. But for the average user a simple factory reset is a living nightmare.So there you have it. Again smartwatches aren't for everyone but there are few there so we have options and more are coming in the near future. If you plan getting a smartwatch do plan ahead of what the watch can do and not on what you want it to do.",

B00FB2XNCE,4,56,64,"December 3, 2013",A3CSZGXOQMPY3P,I tried the Galaxy Gear and liked the SmartWatch 2 better. A much better value.,"I tried out the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch but after a few days returned it and decided to try the Sony SmartWatch 2. This review is a bit of a comparison of the two watches. I hands down prefer the SmartWatch 2 over the Galaxy Gear for several reasons.1) The strength of this watch is that it isn't trying to be everything. Because of that, the price is now 1/2 of what the Galaxy Gear cost and that makes this watch a very good value.2) Don't sweat the lack of camera or speaker phone that the galaxy gear has. The camera was gimicky on the Galaxy Gear and unnecessary. The speakerphone while useful at times in the Galaxy gear, is not something I miss at all now that I've switched to the SmartWatch 2.3) I think the Sony SmartWatch 2 looks better than the Gear. It has a subtlely handsome look and an understated quality feel and appearance to it. You can wear this watch with almost anything and it would not clash or draw attention to.4) I got a few compliments from women and men about my watch the first day I wore it to work. No one has any clue it's a smartwatch at first and just think it looks cool. The Galaxy Gear I thought was more eye catching in a way I didn't like or want.5) The display on the SmartWatch 2 is always showing the time. I love it! The GG has the display off until you bring up your wrist up in front of you to look at the time, then it would delay for an awkward second, before the screen turns on and you can see the time. The SmartWatch 2 is easy to tell the time at any time.6) I work in a hospital and must do constant hand washing. The SmartWatch 2 is waterproof, while the Galaxy Gear is not. I was very afraid to splash water on the GG and it drove me nuts as I don't have time while working to have to worry about drying my watch all the time or trying to protect it from splashes.7) The screen on the SmartWatch looks just fine. It's not as sharp as the GG screen, but it doesn't matter. You can easily read many rows of tiny text on the screen when receiving longer messages. Yes you can see pixels up but so what. It's still perfectly decent display for the use case.8. The SmartWatch UI acts just like Android device. There are back, home and menu keys. There is a swipe down gesture that brings down notifications.9. The black rubber watch band is very comfortable in all day use. I couldn't say that about the Galaxy Gear at all. The Galaxy Gear irritated my wrist throughout a days. Part of the metal clasp of the Gear watch band would rub against my wrist and caused me irritation. Also you can replace the SmartWatch band with any watchband.10. My suggestion is to NOT load a lot of useless apps for use on the Watch. I only install the free &#34;WatchIt!&#34; notification app, along with the gmail and text apps. The WatchIt app will allow you to send any notification that appears on the top of your mobile phone to the watch as well. I started off by blacklisting all apps so they DON'T show notifications. Then I go through and approve only the ones I want. Be conservative in what apps you allow to buzz you on your watch. It will get annoying quickly if you allow dumb stuff to bother you and buzz your wrist all day.11. You'll want the stock text message app as it allows you to view and reply to text messages using preformatted replies. You can create your own pre-formatted replies. I deleted all of the stock pre-formatted replies and created my own. When you get a text alert on the watch, you press the menu button, and then the text message icon button to reply. Then you can swype left or right to cycle between your preset replies. It works pretty well and doesn't try and shove more functionality that just won't work on a smartphone.12. The watch does what it's supposed to do. I can view the time at all times, and it lets me get notifications to my wrist so I don't have to pull out my phone at work (which we have a strict no cell phone policy at work). I don't miss any important calls or text or emails anymore. I know when I have to step outside and deal with a call or text and when it can just wait.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,1,2,"December 1, 2013",A3GW50PDBGVAGK,I'm soooo happy I bought this.,"It is hard to fault this watch. It really does everything I expected it to do when I purchased it. I wish that all the apps worth having didn't also cost money. I also wish that it was sometimes a bit more responsive and that there was a little more documentation on how it works (as well as for some of the apps). That said, I am glad this is the watch I chose. It is a wonderful timepiece -- I love the look and feel on my arm -- and it gives my quick and discreet access to information coming into my phone, in a way that enhance my day to day activities. I no longer have to reach for my hip or into my purse to get the time, to see if I should answer the incoming call or stop and respond to the email I received. Now it's just a quick glance at my wrist.",
B00FB2XNCE,4,1,1,"December 1, 2013",A10JP15CUFQICU,Very nice as a watch and has useful features good second gen,"I thought the first Sony watch was a bit gimmicky with the clip.I wanted a watch that looked like a watch and acted like one with God battery life and could stand up to weather/water.I held out for the galaxy gear but alas it was heavy, short battery life (a day is nuts) had an awkward charger and feels like a bracelet.Granted the galaxy gear is more powerful in that it is actually a standalone android device but it doesn't work for me because the battery life and weight/bulk isn't worth it.The number one thingi like about the Sony sw2 is the screen is visible in direct sunlight. It usesa transflective display like those found on many outdoor GPS units. The watch has a back light too. There is only one button. Press once to turn on the backlight and twice to go to the app screen. The light sensor checks to see if actually you are in bright light and controls the backlight so it is only really on when you need it.  It is true the screen isn't as brilliant in color as the oled on the galaxy gear.. But then if you are in the bright sunlight you cant read your galaxy gear screen.  The Sony sw2 screen when it is 'dark' (no backlight) can be read with normal indoor lighting.  There is no need special code like in the galaxy gear to turn on the screen when you rotate your wrist. The screen watch mode is always present and readable in even low indoor lighting... Lay your watch on a table and you can still read it!And it's that screen that saves battery! I was expecting the bald galaxy gear to do this but no. That takes me to my second like for the Sony sw2... Battery life.  Here I do wish it was longer. I wanted it to be like the pebble but am happy it is multi day.  After my first few days of constant play I didn't expect great life but was happy to see I was getting two full days.  Now that I've settled into a routine of sorts I'm starting to see 3 to 4 days. I would like more but it's nice not to remember to charge it every day.  It uses a micro USB to charge so I can always borrow or charge it else where. No need to carry around a special charger bracelet like the galaxy gear requires.  I also note that it charges fairly fast. Haven't timed it yet but it's so short that I only carry one charger on trips to charge my phone and watch.Style. I like the style. It looks likea watch first and is smart second. Most ppl I show it to don't ask me if it is a smart watch. They see it as a watch and are actually surprised it is a smart watch. Its a nice style. However it is a MENS sized watch. Women may find it a bit large.Water resistant not waterproof. I wish it was waterproof. But I've worn iton my bicycle in the rain and taken it to the shower a few times. I'm hesitant to force getting it emmersed and try to take it off for the shower or swimming. The protection is a small rubber bit inside the charging cover. Mechanically I see the only weakness to the watch is that the charging cover may snap off over time or the seal will wear out and water/dust will eventually get in through the charging port.Apps. While not like the galaxy gear the Sony watch does not run android native. It utilizes the android adk concept (accessory development kit) so the Sony watch is more like a remote display and touch screen to your phone.  This means that it works best when it is actually connected to your phone. The phone is the brains for most of the apps. That helps with battery life but it also means your watch is not very smart when it is not connected to the phone (galaxy gear better if you want a stand alone smart accessory.. Or at least it could be)Apps... I've only download the free apps and I wrote one of my own (take the heartrate from a Bluetooth hr strap and display it on the watch).. I've been able to take notes on the phone and keepa copy on the watch (after you save the note it is on your phone and watch even if the watch is later disconnected from your phone).. Sync email (can't edit/send with the app I've chosen) get SMS (can send pure written replies but can't actually edit to send SMS but assume just app limitation)I've used the Bluetooth range anda phone finder app a lot. The watch vibrates when it loses connection with the phone and vibrates again when in range. If I can't find the phone once it is connected a find phone free app can be used on the watch to make the phone play a tune.Execution. The watch is fairly stable though I've experienced a few quirks that has required to pair again. I think it had to do withmy phone Bluetooth settings and some of the free sw1 apps not being stable.  Overall it is stable enough for me to keep.",
B00FB2XNCE,3,0,0,"November 30, 2013",A18U49406IPPIJ,"Made For Sony Phones, Works OK With Android Phones","This is a great watch right out of the box. The watch has the look and fell of a standard wrist watch, with a metal bezel and band. As far as bands go, there are multiple options, any 24mm band can be used to personalize. The only sign of not being a regualar watch is the big plug where the micro USB charging port is located, which sould have be located under the watch for asthetic reasons. The battery lasted 3 days with multiple alerts and notifications, best to charge the watch while sleeping, which only takes 2-3 hours. The watch can be paired with NFC or bluetooth. Once paired, the watch has a limited number of apps, waiting for more to come. This watch is truly and extension of your smart phone. The watchs screen displays icons much similar to the ones on your phone. There are apps for answering the phone, twitter, facebook and so on. The only achilles heel of this watch is that the default email function ONLY works with Sony phones, which is a big slap in the face. In this day and age of technology, you would think that a watch that notifies you of GMail, twitter and facebook would be able to notify you of my hotmail or yahoo email. If the default email function and charging location were solved this watch would be 5 stars. The Smart Watch 2 is by no means a bad watch, just a watch that has to evolve.",

I really wanted to use the watch as a control for the music on my phone while working out but this is sketchy at best the title and artists dont show on the watch and there is no control for pandora or any other music software that I could find.

So I sold the Pebble and decided this whole watch thing wasn't for me.  I really don't know what got me to buy this Sony watch, but it has certainly surprised me.  It does more than the Pebble, it's faster, looks better, has about the same battery life, and is actually quite comfortable.

B00FB2XNCE,5,1,1,"August 2, 2014",A2SKPNQYQCH8HA,Exactly what I needed!,"I love it -- I don't want to talk into or take pix from my wrist and I needed water resistance.  We have a sailing school and charter company (Emerald Coast Yachts) that I basically run from my cell phone.  To keep my phone safe from the conditions, it is stowed a lot... or we are playing music through the boat stereo from my phone, which means it is in the interior cabin.  This watch allows us to manage the music from the cockpit (awesome), sets up great hand free shots (nice selfies!), but best of all I can see who is calling and decide if I need to get to my phone.  It also sends me the subject & from of emails coming in, forwards my texts and calendar reminders.  I can even reply to texts from my wrist -- but just simple replies.  I can even send lists or notes to my wrist (easier grocery shopping).  I have an app that shows street maps with my location too. I have also loaded a browser and have set bookmarks for just the sites I want to see on my wrist (radar, weather) Using the watchit app, you can get notifications from ANY app sent to the watch!  It comes with a walking and a running app that work very well... not sure the pedometer measures steps accurately, but the run app uses GPS. Battery lasts about 4 days for me with light use, but I charge it nightly when at home.  Love that the charger is just a mini-USB, same as my phone, same as many other devices we use. THIS WATCH IS SO GREAT!  The only con is that I can't clear the notifications easily -- you have to clear them one at a time, which is annoying if you have a lot of them stacked up... when my hands are busy, I just look at the notification and don't clear it.  When I get back in from sailing, I easily have 50 notifications that need to be cleared -- wish it could be done from the app on my phone in one step, as the apps were designed.  Sony made some change in the software recently, so apps are not able to clear history any more.  Hopefully the developers will be able to adjust that soon.  NOTE that the watch is large and the screen can get scratched (I didn't put screen protection on mine), but I'm a small person and the watch fits my needs without looking too goofy. Pairs beautifully with my Motox.  When resetting, it often takes a try or two to get it to pair, but once it is set up, it rarely looses Bluetooth pairing.  There really isn't a need to reset the watch once it is set up first time, but I was doing that to clear the history... not a great way to do it as WatchIT just sends the notifications again!  My phone connects with my car and the watch at the same time -- love that I don't have to tinker or pick one over the other.  Sometimes my phone won't connect to either, but that is not the fault of the watch or my car, I believe.",

B00FB2XNCE,5,142,159,"October 13, 2013",A14JY94Y0UX5D7,Works as it should,"I have had the watch for about a week and found I to be very useful.I wanted a smartwatch I could use to get notifications while my phone was in my bag. While most smartwatches accomplish  this task, the sony does so while being dust and waterproof, able to be read in bright sun, and having the battery last more than two days in normal use.Let's talk about the set up:I have a galaxy 4 and had to download the Smart Connect app from google play. The watch paired quickly using the NFC chip. It prompts you to download the software, and you use the Smart Connect software to download/buy more apps.Most of the useful apps are free. I bought a few more such as a calculator app, a calendar app, and a notification app.Using the watch :The watch is very light and fits well for its size. You can choose any 24mm conventional watch band to change the look of the watch. The display is bright and has a good resolution for the screen size. I really don't see a problem with the resolution during normal use. When the watch is in sleep mode, the numbers are easy to read in the sun but you may have to push the power button in dim light because the screen uses reflected, ambient light for the display in sleep mode.The screen is responsive, albeit the apps sometimes take a bit to load. I have not found a way to arrange the icons to my liking, but I hope this is addressed soon.I ride a motorcycle and attend many meetings. Both of these activities lend themselves well to the use of a smartwatch I can leave my phone in my pocket or bag and still get updates from gmail,phone calls,texts,and weather without anyone noticing, or taking my hands off the handlebars.Charging is easy via micro USB port. It has about a 30 foot range from the phone and reconnects easily when you come within range againOverall, it is a great product which accomplishes everything it is intended to do. I needed the waterproof capability and liked the fact you can change the band.UPDATE-I have had more compliments on this watch than my Tag or Breitling! It really is a modern, sophisticated watchI sometimes have to restart my phone in order to get it to work (the screen becomes unresponsive). I don't know if this is due to the watch, apps, or a connectivity issue. Not a big deal in my book, but something to be aware of.",
B00FB2XNCE,3,1,9,"October 11, 2013",A9JMH340CTJOU,Looks great,"It looks great and pairs really quick. But, it is not fully compatible with the Note 3. Good idea in progress.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,27,30,"October 10, 2013",A3J1LDRKMM7NAB,Pleasantly surprised,"Smartwatches are such a new product category that I wasn't really sure what to expect from the Sony Smartwatch 2. But my inner nerd has fond memories of the old Casio Databank watches of the 1980s, and for $200 I thought it would at least be worth trying out. While the Sony Smartwatch 2 is not perfect, I am actually surprised how polished it is. To me it seems like the best smartwatch on the market right now by quite a margin.Design is more important for a watch than for most personal electronics and I think this is a really strong simple design. One big button on the side that is really easy to press and the rest is touch control. It is a little wider than I would prefer, but looking at the huge chunky watches everyone on public transport is sporting, it appears I am not in the majority in that opinion. I have the metal band which looks great, but it is quite a lot heavier than the silicone band. I usually wear a titanium band and it took me a week to get used to the extra weight. I would put a titanium band on this (you can swap in any 24mm band) but I can't find a black one.The screen is great.  I have read that the resolution is not as good as the Samsung Gear but on a display this small it is perfectly adequate. You are not going to be reading novels on it. The transreflective display is excellent. Outdoors in sunlight, like magic, the display becomes black and white and remains very easy to read. The basic watchface stays on all the time in this black and white mode and this means it is always easy to check the time, which after all is the most important feature of any watch.The functionality is really good. Althought the product is new, I had no problems with pairing the watch with my Nexus 4 using NFC and once you do that, connectivity is handled automatically. It just connects via bluetooth when you are near the phone. When you are not near the phone, the watchface and other apps which don't need a data connection (calculator, games etc) work as normal.App selection is excellent. Smartwatch 1 apps work on Smartwatch 2 which means there is already really good range of apps in the Play Store, including Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. Smartwatch Notes lets you put simple notes on your watch, and you can send notes from Google Keep, useful for to do lists. Find My Phone rings your phone so you can find the damn thing under all the papers on your desk.Battery life is good. From my experience, the watch will last about 3-4 days on a charge. It largely depends on how often you use its apps so that the screen has to light up. As mine is new, I have been fiddling with it a lot and it still lasts 3 days easily.The Sony Smartwatch 2 does have some shortcomings. Most fundamentally, it is not designed as a standalone device - it does not have its own data connection, a camera or a speaker. I don't know what the memory is but it clearly cannot store a huge amount of data. It is designed as a 'watch-plus' not a miniature phone. I am fine with this, frankly I think that a watch-sized device will always be fiddly to use to make calls, take photos etc and will have to make sacrifices in size and battery life. But there are a few devices that are going that way, most prominently the Galaxy Gear, so there are options if that's what you are after.I kind of expected that a new product in a new product category would have some major flaws, and I'm pleased to report it does not. It does everything you would expect a 'watch-plus' product to do and does them in a really smooth polished way. If you are looking for a watch which works seamlessly with your Android phone, and want some tech-cred on the side, this is the best option at the moment.EDIT (13 Oct 2013): I experienced an issue which may affect others so I thought it was worth sharing. I had the metal wrist band adjusted to quite a tight fit and after a week or so I found that the screen had lifted up slightly above the bezel on the right side of the display. On closer inspection, the watch comprises an aluminium 'frame' around the actual electronics. Evidently the glue between the electronics and the frame was not strong enough to withstand continuous pressure on the back of the watch and if the watch is tightly fitted, the electronics section can lift up on the right side (the left side has the charging port so I guess that prevents that side raising up). I applied a small amount of superglue to the exposed section of frame at the back of the watch and pushed the electronics section back down and let the glue set. The problem has not recurred so far. To be safe I will get the band loosened a bit. The watch is still under warranty so I can send it back if the issue recurs. I noticed that when the screen was raised, it made the side button unresponsive (because it was out of alignment), so if you notice the button becomes hard to press, this could be your problem.EDIT (16 Oct 2013): I originally wrote that there is currently no way to silence the watch at night. Turns out you can do this by setting an Event in the Sony SmartConnect app on your phone.EDIT (2 May 2014): New firmware has been issued which addresses several issues identified in my original review: the lack of a calculator and custom watch faces. I have updated the review accordingly. The good news is that all of the 'negatives' I identified in my original review have now been fixed - perhaps someone at Sony read my review!",
B00FB2XNCE,5,2,4,"October 10, 2013",A17NOXCL7M21F5,Great Purchase!,"I've been using my new watch for the last two days. It meets all of my expectations. I have not had any problems with the watch whatsoever. Sony greatly improved ability of the watch since the last model. I love the fact that you can actually respond to SMS messages with predefined text. The display is easily readable indoor & outdoors even without hitting the power button on the side to brighten the display. I still have about 30 percent battery left and haven't charged it since day one. I receive between 50 to 100notifications per day between various email accounts, Google Now, weather alerts, system notifications, etc.The only things that are missing is the music widget and clock face (with time, day, and date) that is shown in some of the promotion photos and videos. Also Sony needs to add a way to check exchange emails, or any emails from the stock email app. The email extension works only work the email app on Sony phones. I use a third-party extention to check my email on the watch.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,173,191,"October 10, 2013",A3LMUTT4V5P0QG,As Useful as I Hoped - Better than Galaxy Gear,"I've had my SW2 for a few days now and haven't taken it off (except to sleep). I was looking for a device that would allow me to check texts, calls, emails and other notifications without getting my phone out and the SW2 does the job very nicely. Overall I find it incredibly useful.What I like:Not as bulky as I thought - Although the pictures of it make it look very large, it feels like a regular watch. Not too bulky or heavy at all and very comfy. I was able to compare it to a friends Samsung Galaxy Gear and the Samsung was very bulky compared to this one.Functionality - Checking messages and updates right on the watch is very easy and intuitive.Battery lasts longer than expected. It looks like I can go at least 2 full days, maybe 3 before charging. I was expecting to have to charge every night.Apps - There are a whole bunch of apps already out for this watch and more coming all the time.Doesn't have mic, camera or speaker. Some may consider this a fault, but I actually never planned to use these features that other smart watches have (who really wants to make calls by talking into the watch?). I'm glad Sony chose to pass on them to make the watch slimmer.What I didn't like so much:Screen resolution - The resolution seems pretty low. Considering you are reading very small text regularly, I wish it had a sharper screen (the Samsung has better screen resolution).Got stuck on setup - After connecting to the phone and installing the required software, the watch stuck on a screen wanting me to sync with the phone again though it already was. I ended up having to reset the watch a couple times during setup. However, once it began working, it kept working. Haven't had any problems since. I didn't even try to use the NFC pairing because I've never done it and it's easy enough to pair the usual way.Overall, the SW2 does everything I was looking for without being too bulky or expensive. If you're debating between this or the (more expensive) Samsung Galaxy Gear, get this one (unless you really need to be able to talk to the watch or take pictures from it).",
B00FB2XNCE,5,473,488,"October 7, 2013",A3BTC9DYVJL4XY,Sony Smartwatch Part 2 (3rd edition),"I have the previous edition SW1 and I decided to upgrade to this year's model.  Compared to last year's edition, this is a complete redesign.  Sony basically addressed all the complaints from last years model and has taken most of the advantages of the Pebble Smartwatch away. Everything is better including the look, fit, and finish.  I get a lot of compliments for how good the watch looks.  Last year's model was almost a iPod Nano with a watch strap.Here are the pros:-bigger and better screen (1.3' vs 1.6'-full Transflective display 220x176 & scratch-resistant)-longer battery life (3-7 days depending on usage vs 2-3 days previously)-more touch sensitive-back/home/menu buttons like all Android phones-menu is easier to use (no touch controls to close apps or swiping up and down)-settings in watch to switch clocks and apps (some apps still require in phone settings)-easier setup with NFC and tap with phone (make sure you enable NFC in your phone)-water resistant IP57 (30 minutes in FRESH water up to a depth of 1 meter & dust proof)-lots of free apps (weather, currency, photo slideshow, Twitter, Facebook, GPS, games like Blackjack etc.)-easier to charge with standard micro USB charger (proprietary connection previously)-easier to see in daylight-watch is always on to tell time but dims to save battery, push power button to lighten up (previous model turned off with no time display)-works with any Android smartphone running version 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or later-aluminum body (plastic body previously)-ability to change watch band (it can take any standard watch strap that is 24 millimeters wide).-all previous apps work from last year's modelcons:-limited apps out made for the SW2, but this will change as it's just been released-currently only 5 watch faces in settings (there are paid apps with more)What do I use my watch for?-Tell time of course, but also with the ability to change the look each day (almost a new watch daily).-Notifications for emails, texts, tweets, and calls (discreetly reading a text during a meeting or while driving or in a theater).-Never miss a call again when you are outside (watch vibrates when calls come in, you can answer or end call--still need phone to talk).-Finding my phone (I can call my phone from the watch to hear where I left it).-Never leave your phone behind again (because it's connected by bluetooth, the watch will vibrate to notify if you are too from it or the connection has been lost).-There are unlimited uses as more apps become available.  Some others include a flashlight, viewing my camera while I'm away from my phone, remotely turning phone to silent or vibrate mode etc.Note: Sony created 'Open Smarthwatch Project' this past summer to third-party firmware which enables any developer to create apps for their smartwatches.  So there is no need to worry about a lack of future support.  This watch is actually Sony's third smartwatch.  In 2010 Sony Ericsson unveiled the 'LiveView Watch' and 2012 Sony released 'SmartWatch 1' (bought out Ericsson).Update Oct 23rd, 2013I've had the watch for just over two weeks now.  I've managed to get almost 7 days battery life by turning the watch off each night before bed.  Without turning it off, I managed to get about 5 days.  So if you are lazy at charging, turn off the watch to get an extra couple of days.  Another tip for a fast charge (approx. 1 hour), I use a 10 watt AC adapter charger that came with my Nexus 7--like I mentioned, that standard micro USB is handy.  These 10 watt AC adapter chargers can be found online for $10.Update 2 Dec 6, 2013I received a free update for the watch last night, Sony has doubled the total watch faces to 10!  There are some very nice designs from digital, analog, and classic museum styles.Anyone trying to decide between the Sony SW2 or Samsung Gear may want to read this article:Sony outsmarts Samsung with SmartWatch 2[...]",
B00FB2XNCE,4,3,5,"October 7, 2013",AL749J5MD9UFW,Correction: Works with original Galaxy Note after software update,"My initial review stated that this watch does not work with original Galaxy Note.  That was the case until I updated the Android version (still had Android 2.3 until today(!)).  Now it seems to work great, as far as I can tell.Initial impressions:Pros-Very lightweight and comfortable to wear-Really cool passive transflective screen displays 100% of the time, even without backlight-Robust vibrations for notifications, and backlight can get BRIGHT when activated-Preliminarily appears true that battery life is ~3-4 daysCons-Still a little bulky (and I'm a medium-large guy with medium-large hands/wrists)-Software on the phone seems to have a bug where I got stuck on the 'search for apps' screen, and cannot navigate back to preferences.  Back button, home button, menu button, and touching any part of the screen do nothing to solve it.  Not sure how I'm going to fix this.  Please leave a comment on this review if you have any ideas.-While the display is sharp, pixellation is very apparent with the backlight on.  Resolution was a big concern when I was trying to decide between buying this watch and the Galaxy Gear (am planning to get galaxy note 3 soon).  In the end I decided that even though the Galaxy Gear has a much better resolution, the Galaxy Gear's ~1-day battery life and extra bulkiness were both dealbreakers on their own.Bottom lineConsidering the smart watches available at this time and in the forseeable near future (Pebble, Kreyos, Galaxy Gear, Vachen, Qualcomm Toq, and others), I believe the Sony Smartwatch 2 is absolutely the best purchase.  It really has the best combination of specs, looks, (and even value, as if that is a concern for you, considering you are looking at purchasing a smartwatch to begin with).  I have no doubt the software will rapidly improve due to the popularity of this product.",

Charging the watch is easy as it takes a standard mini usb cable.  Once charged I attempted to pair it to my Samsung Note 2 with NFC, that was a no go but manually pairing it with Bluetooth is no problem took about 30 seconds.  Once paired it was simple to download the control app to the phone and setup the apps I wanted on the watch.  Chose the watch face I wanted and strapped it on.  Looks good on the arm and functions great.  Not having to dig the phone out for every email or notification is great.  I have the phoned paired to my Hyundai Accent for hands free calling and have not seen any problems with making or receiving calls or quality issues.  Hope more apps are developed in the future but to be honest can't think of anything else it could do that it doesn't do now.  Sony should advertise and push this product I think it is a keeper.",

Ive had it for a few months and even with the new android wear devices coming out, i do enjoy wearing the watch. But only as a watch! its nice that i can read texts on my wrist and send a quick predefined response back while im at work, but everything else is pretty much useless, i can only get gmails on the watch not my other messages and the music control app is really slow, but i still love to wear it as a high tech watch, i wear it everyday and feel incomplete if i leave it at home. I turn it off at night so the battery last all week for me! I did notice a sharp decrease in battery life with the facebook app installed! Sony still releases updates and new features for this watch! The watch looks nice, not too big but the screen isnt too small, and  not too thick eitherIf you are a watch or gadget person, i would still recommend this watch! i usually pay around $100 for my watches any way, i will be purchasing a moto 360 or another android wear device later this year but ill still wear this from time to time!",

B00FB2XNCE,5,2,2,"February 1, 2014",A6B87FQ51J6JG,A great notification triage device,"Have had the SW2 for 2 Months.  If someone asked me about &#34;wearable tech&#34; 9 Months ago, I would have replied that it was just another clever marketing method to remove someones $$$ from their pocket for something unneeded. But now I can't go anywhere without it. The SW2 doesn't try to be some overly functional device that attempts to merge human & machine in some  Kurzweilian Singularity.  It provides the huge convenience of NOT having to pull ones SmartPhone out of their pocket/purse - slide/unlock/tap/tap/slide/tap - just to see a meaningless notification of someone tweeting how they just began a new stick of gum. For those of us that live on emails/text for business, we really don't know which notification is important until we see the sender/subject, this device saves a huge amount of time.  I get about 90 notifications/day - AFTER filtering them.  About 4% are important (enough) business/family notifications.  I calculated it took me 23 seconds on average to fish my phone out of my pocket, (by the time I got it out, that notification bar at the top was gone) then do the - slide/unlock/tap/tap/slide/tap - dance.  Which means (90 x 23 =) 34.5 minutes a day I am checking emails/text.  Now, its basically ZERO minutes to check.  34 minutes/day x 365 days adds up to a lot of wasted life.Is the SW2 a fashion statement?  Hardly. Reminds me of the 1970's era LCD watches. But is is nice to have a watch on the wrist again. It's held up very well so far.  I've bumped it several times and no damage. Bluetooth range is about 60' in non obstructed area - but does sync back up quickly when back in range. Notifications can take as long as 15 seconds to get to the watch after they come into the smartphone (mine is an Xperia). The spring-pin thingy that keeps the band on the watch has come off twice. Since I only have it set to give me text/email notifications and none of the other apps, battery life is about 4 days. The screen resolution is &#34;ok&#34;, good enough to easily read notifications, but very cool watch faces, like a chronograph watch face I downloaded, look horrible. Moreover, one of the best features is the vibration.  With the smartphone sound off, I'm in complete stealth mode, and I no longer annoy those around me with bells and buzzers, and silly ringtones going off like I'm a slot machine ready to payoff.Like the good old days, when folks owned more than one watch, I may invest in some of the nicer looking smartwatches (Neptu&#8203;ne Pine, Burg smartwatch, sonostar, the Italian &#34;i'm watch&#34;, or pebble steel), assuming they have a similar functionality.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,1,1,"February 1, 2014",AIQXEC14E5EEP,Great Accessory,"I have had my watch for 3 days, and I love it. Don't make the mistake of expecting something other than a phone accessory, because it is not a stand alone computer. What you get is the ability to read text, emails, Facebook, twitter, and see the weather forecast and temperature without taking your phone out of your pocket. I love that feature. hurry check the time.... ok, that's how long it takes to get messages from these different accounts. Your wrist vibrates (which is good, because I always have my phone on silent and never feel the vibration in my pocket) and you look down at your wrist and POW there it is, your text. I have found everything works great and it's really quick, not laggy. The only thing in the description that I would disagree with is the battery life time. My watch has no trouble lasting all day (and that's with a new watch and you know how us guys are with a new &#34;toy&#34;) but it doesn't last 4 days. That is not a problem for me, as I charge my phone daily, so charging my watch daily is no big task. I like the price as it is 100  bucks cheaper than the Gear (I have a Note 2) but I didn't need to talk to my wrist or take pictures with a 1.9 pixel camera. It looks a lot better than the Pebble, I haven't tried either of these and I am sure they are great, but I didn't want a Big Plastic looking watch on my wrist like the Pebble and didn't want to wait on the steel.

B00FB2XNCE,2,8,13,"November 16, 2013",A1D36KAPWAUPTJ,Sony products disappoint me again..,"I bought the watch because i watch markets often and i don't want to constantly pull my phone out to refresh a widget and what not. So i did some research as i always do (apparently not enough) and I checked to make sure the sony's smartwatch had widgets.. i saw the picture's that sony advertises with and saw the widgets... I said 'good'. i also read widget support for the first gen smart watch, from there i assumed (apparently foolishly..) that since the first gen had widgets, the 2nd gen would too.Nope. No widgets... this watch should never have been sold.. its beyond not ready for release.. I received it in good time (thanks amazon) but after playing around with it for a few hours, I was beyond disapointed  when i learned that Sony hasn't released widget support for SW2 yet.. Really sony? They are advertising it using widgets.. something it can't do yet.. It's so frustrating.. that should be illegal.As far as other things went..BODY: The watch looks sexy and sleek.. It was beautiful. the screen looked nice, it was perfect size for my wrist (I am tall)., The default wristband was a little awkward cause the flap would stick up a little bit.Responsiveness: It is pretty responsive, expected nothing less, nothing more, so that is good.Apps: Here was the nail in the coffin for disappointment Half the apps were beyond useless and MOST of these useless apps cost 1-3$.. the app selection is a joke. But that is excusable because the watch is new. But basically it does nothing cool right now, especially with no widget support.. there isn't much it can do.. Twitter/facebook/call notification/sms. that is about it.I didnt use the facebook app, and i only test called myself once, but i couldn't even control the call from the watch. All it did was vibrate on my wrist and say that i was receiving a call.The twitter app was really neat.. when it worked.. I liked how it vibrated and then showed the new tweet on the watch.. But there is 0 ways to control the app.. the only function you have is to scroll through.. the real kicker is that there isn't even a refresh.. the tweets just came in when they felt like it. The menu digitizer on the watch has no purpose right now, almost no apps use it and twitter is no exception. I even tried refreshing twitter and pulling new tweets directly from my phone.. the watch did not react. Twitter app is a 2/5 at best.The native camera app (you can take pictures on your phone from your watch) never even opened for me! it crashed everytime i tried to launch it (HTC evo 3D, my phone was probably the problem here, not the watch). but i downloaded a third party camera app to try it out. Wow... it had to be like 5 fps on the watch, which tells me the bluetooth connection is slow (i am not sure if bluetooth is capable of 30fps tbh, But i think it is) or that means the CPU in this watch is garbage... 1/5 for the camera control appsI didn't get a text message while using this, but i'm sure the basic functionality of reading the text and using a quick reply was there. so that is good.At the end of the day, the watch was an overpriced paperweight... all flash and no bang. If this was half the price it could be worth it.. and if they would fix widgets i'd probably pay ~130 for it. but 200$ for this is a joke, i'd stay clear.I would rate it a 1/5 because of its price/performance, but it looks so nice.. that bumps the value up a star.I ended up returning it 2 days after.",

Not too bad. I usually get about 2 days of battery, sometimes 3 but never more. Not that big a deal if you don't want to wear it to bed, just charge it. (Don't want the notifications to wake you with a buzz telling you that there is a new sale on Amazon, right?) Battery charges in about a half hour or so, not an issue. Resolution is not super high but even with my old tired eyes I can see the text good enough to read everything. Colors show up well and it is cool to be able to show photos taken on my S3 via my watch to people. The look of the watch is not too bad either. I mean it looks like a watch and not much bigger, if any, than any other mans watch. Fairly stylish too. It is cool to have and wear, but most people ask if it is the new Samsung smartwatch. Most people didn't even know there was such a thing until Samsung started their marketing a few weeks ago and this is V2 of the Sony product.**Wish list**1: I wish there were more watch faces. If you install a non-Sony face the battery lasts less than a day. There are only 5 faces to choose from and only one of them digital. I want a 'regular' HH:MM digital display with a 12 hour display not the 24HR military type, perhaps with he date underneath. Simple. It would be nice if there was a configuration option that would do this, not simply choose between faces. The analog faces are quite nice though.2: It would be EXTREMELY useful if it could dictate an SMS message and send like Google can. I'd love to be able to receive a text and dictate my reply and be done instead of breaking out the phone.3: More apps. (Not Sony's fault.) It would be real cool if there was an app development kit that was like VBA, HTML, or some 'easey drag & drop' method. It would be cool, that's all.**The Not So Good**Setup took a bit of time. It is supposed to use NFC but I couldn't get it to work I manually downloaded the app to my S3 phone and manually paired via Bluetooth. After that all was good. It does freeze up every now ant then but switching off then back on clears it up. Once, right at 3 weeks it completely locked up. This was a pain because there are more than a few users out there that the SW2 locks up on and there is little help to fix. On the Sony site there is re-installation software but I could not get the SW2 to be recognized via USB by a Sony computer to run the software. I did get the watch operational but I had to uninstall all software and reboot a few times. Now I have to re install software and complete the setup process again.Bottom Line:+It is cool+I like the convenience+Good screen-It freezes up-Setup could have been better-Could do more+It's coolBuy or don't? If you need lunch money, don't bother. It is a toy. But if you have nothing better to blow your cash on, you already have a tablet and you need to up your geek ante, why not.",

Also without a shake to wake, or double tap to wake feature its a bit annoying to always have to press to wake (turn back light on) your watch at night.-Battery life lasts at least 4+ days with medium usage. Take about 4-5 hours to fully charge.- *The water resistant statement seemed true until I used it while stuck outdoors during a heavy storm for a few hours (hiking/camping). Later that night I noticed the watch was turned off, even though it should have had about 80-75% battery left. After trying to charge and turning it on and off for a few days I finally gave up.

You must be running Android 4.2 or greater on your phone!You must download the Sony app called Smart Connect to download apps that are specific to the watch. The caveat here is that you need to have purchased and paired the two in order to see 'what it can do'. There is no clear way to evaluate the capabilities prior to purchase.This can also be said for the Samsung Gear device as well. I look at this the same as I would the 15 minute app evaluation offered by the Play Store except on a higher dollar level. Neither offer the consumer a comfortable evaluation level.One can only hope there will be better OEM firmware updates and better 'useful' third party apps on the horizon. Case in point and obviously one of the major detraction's to the Smartwatch 2 is the limited selection of clock faces!Granted there is a third party app called Custom Watch that adds 14 new watch face templates that are customizable but this app suffers in that it closes when the watch display goes into sleep, as it will revert back to the Sony clock face in embedded in firmware.I should point out that there is an option to do what the developer calls Use as Watch, which keeps the Custom Face focused at the risk of a faster battery depletion.Another minor annoyance is the leading Zero digit always displayed. Example: 8:12PM will read 08:12 even though the PM is displayed. You can also select 24 hour clock as a work around to this if you prefer a military time style display.Also I should mention that the charging port cover does not offer much purchase for the fingernail to open, it is a plastic not rubber type door. With that said the watch body and wake button are very well made. The black silicone strap so far seems impervious to collecting lint that some straps are prone to do.The alert vibrate is perfect on this watch quiet but noticable with a non adjustable 10 second display timeout. The OS is reasonably fast and fluid on it. The Sony branded GMail and SMS extensions (as they are called) will prove useful to most buyers and there are several extensions from Sony that others will find important like the included fitness app, twitter, remote camera, find phone, calendar, facebook, etc.There are many free game and game like apps on the Play Store that are interesting but not very productive for just killing 'Time' ;)Compared to Smartwatch 1 with the LiveWare bluetooth connectivity this watch is superior in its ability to discretely stay in the loop with email and sms. But not so much to customize it as amoled watch. But compared to Samsung's Gear with the whopping 1.9Mpix wart on the band this watch has more appeal to it and hopefully the Gear 2 will be absent of the camera feature for a sleeker wear.All in all it's a nice product and after fiddling with it for a few days i'll be keeping it, but as an honest review with this firmware revision it's just not ready for prime Time unless one insists on up to the second notifications of incoming communications.EDIT UPDATE:- As of yesterday 1/7/2014; there was an update to the Custom Watch app which lets you set AND KEEP ALIVE any of the Custom Watch faces even after the 10 second time out before the watch falls into sleep mode or what Sony calls Low Power. What this means to the wearer is that you do not have to re-select a custom face any time you pick up the watch or back out of a SMS/email read.It also looks like he did some power refinements as well. After installing the update yesterday and then a full charge now it's 24 hours later the battery reads 90% full charge. So now I upgrade it from meh to ehh.",
B00FB2XNCE,1,97,125,"December 17, 2013",A1HRXARQBPTHU2,"Nice concept, but horrible manufacturing quality!  Avoid!","Let me first start off by saying that I actually liked this smart watch.  I have the original Smart Watch 1 by Sony as well, and compared to that model, this one is 100% better.  Unlike the previous model, you can actually see the screen in the daylight and the watch works as a watch (i.e., it will tell you the time) even when disconnected from the phone.  For SW2, I bought the metal wrist-band, so it had a nice heavy weight to it like a real watch.  It works great as a notification device, so that you don't have to constantly check your phone, especially in meetings where that would be inappropriate.Having said all that, however, the manufacturing quality on this is HORRIBLE!!  The first SW2 that I got died within 3 weeks.  The screen froze and completely bricked and would not power off or reset no matter what I tried.  I waited a few hours, but no change what-so-ever.  Luckily, I was within my 30 day return period, so I exchanged it for a new one.The second SW2 worked fine for about 5 weeks.  Then one day, when I glanced at my wrist, I noticed that the watch was missing!  I still had the metal wrist-band on my wrist, but the watch itself (i.e., the square unit) had popped out of the frame/case that was attached to the wrist band.  [Check out my photos in the Image Gallery.]It turns out that while my wrist-band is metal, the watch itself is plastic and very light.  That is why I had not noticed that it had popped out during the day, because the wrist-band accounts for 95% of the weight.There are two major manufacturing defects with this: (1) the plastic watch unit is glued onto the metal frame.  GLUED!  It's not screwed on or bolted.  Sony used single lines of glue on each of the 4 sides!!!  [See my photo in the Image Gallery.] (2) Once the glue wears off, the watch pops out outward easily, because the frame that watch rests on does not encase the watch on the face side of the watch, but instead, it encases the watch unit on the bottom side - the side that rests against your wrist.  Of course the watch will pop out if there's nothing but a thin line of glue holding the plastic unit onto the frame!!!I called Sony warranty at least 4 times, but they all refused to help me on account that I lost the main watch unit.  I explained and they even agreed that it is a manufacturing defect that the watch unit popped out of the frame.  But, because I don't have the main unit, they claim they cannot replace it under warranty.  It didn't matter that the only reason I lost the watch unit is because it popped out of the frame due to the manufacturing defect.This is so typical of Sony!!!  They make products that are clearly not manufactured with high quality, and they back up their products with poor customer service.  I highly doubt you would ever see an Apple product or Apple customer service like this.",
B00FB2XNCE,3,1,2,"December 15, 2013",A1F3D1ZFTCRWF8,It was great while it worked,"The Sony Watch proved to be something I really learned to rely on. Getting weather, text messages and summary emails without having to grab the phone out of my pocket proved to be an incredible convenience. you cold also reject an incoming call and send a reply text. I could reject the call but didn't have the watch long enough to learn how to send a pre-written message after ejecting the call.I wish the watch had a speaker phone and the ability to reply to a text or email using voice recognition. Going to get the Samsung Watch to get those features and bet in two years watches will be ubiqous.Bad stuff: Could never get the software update from Sony to download onto the watch from my windows 8.1 laptop.Watch suddenly stopped working and would not turn on after charging one night and initially appeared to be asking for the software to be updated. watch died less than a couple of weeks of use and just would not turn on.Love the features, once I got used to them I wanted more as a watch being an extension of my droid phone screen on my wrist is an incredible convenience. It's OK if it kept working. If your into this type of stuff you will be wanting the watch to do more than it does.",

I own a Samsung Galaxy S2 and it is the sad, pathetic truth that the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch will not work with the Samsung Galaxy S2. I read the reviews a hundred times on this watch, debating for a couple of days before I finally decided to break down and buy it. It connected right up as easily as you could hope for and there are all of the apps that you could really hope to have on your wrist. You won't be able to get outlook mail on your phone directly and this was a big part for me as I wanted to make it easier to keep up with work and school email. A simple fix to this though is to simply set a rule in outlook to redirect your email address to a gmail email address. You will find that you can use gmail with a lot more apps/features elsewhere anyway. I will add more if need be as I have only had the watch for 2 days at this point but I am very happy with my purchase as of now.",

First, the design is very stylish yet functional.  The screen is a large responsive touch screen that also looks great as a watch.  I've gotten nothing but compliments on how the watch looks.  That being said, Sony didn't skimp on functionality, as the screen and watch in general is very responsible.  It also has a large repository of applications that is only growing, as anyone can create one and sell it on the Google Play Store.  I've heard that the watch doesn't work all that well with non-Sony devices (which I don't doubt) but it works great with my Sony phone.  If you have a Sony device and are in need of a watch, I highly recommend the SmartWatch 2.

It has several useful features. The first is that it vibrates when you get a text/email/phone call. This is useful in noisy environments or when you want your phone to be silent (in many cases a phones vibrate is pretty obvious). Second is the ability to do a quick look and see if the text or email (or incoming call) is worth pulling your phone out for. Very handy when traveling, driving or otherwise occupied.  If you have an ear piece in you can answer from the watch. Third is the interface with the phone calendar and alarms, it syncs these with the phone and allows you to create much more detailed alerts than just setting an alarm. The phone does not have to be with you for them to work, just need to sync every once and a while. I have a Sony phone and the watch can act as a camera remote, it gives you a remote view and you command the phone to take pictures or movies, kind of handy. Charge seems to last about three days, and uses the same USB charger as most phones. Size is good, not to obvious, works fine in outside daylight. Range is good, I can get 30-50 feet on a good day, which means I can leave my phone on the charger and wander throughout the house.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,3,4,"October 26, 2013",A33CL9Y8Y90652,Great watch,"I like watches for fashion. I chose the Sony over Samsung for a couple of reasons. You can download an app that lets you customize your watch faces. I can change it to match my outfit i.e. snake, zebra, leopard, all kinds of colored backgrounds. You can also swap out the wristband and get rid rid of the stock silicon one. I hope more apps are made for it like a stand alone pedometer app to name one. Not being to talk on the watch was not an issue for me as I don't wish to walk around holding my arm up (especially for lengthy conversations, plus that's too much work); I have a headset. You can place calls and reject calls with stock text messages. My phone is buried in a case, in my purse, in my tote bag...whole lotta work just to get to my missed text. If you use the Sony watch faces, the battery charge is great. Because I use the third-party app to see my matching watch face, the battery needs to charge everyday. That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make! Overall, I am pleased with my watch. I was kinda worried that it would look to dude-ish, but I have made it work.",
B00FB2XNCE,2,7,11,"October 26, 2013",A209G57KXCBF4C,One Big Problem,"I like this watch.  But there is one big problem nobody has mentioned (that I have seen).  While it doesn't look too big on my wrist..  its dimensions are such (just wide and thick enough) that it doesn't slip under my sleeve cuff, even with the looser button in use.  So it causes my shirt to be hiked up and it sticks out.  If I tuck it under, it is tight... and won't slip out with out my other hand helping.. to see the time!!  This is a deep six for this watch.  If it won't slip easily in and out from under my sleeve cuff, it is just a nuisance.  I hear the Galaxy Gear is bigger but slightly narrower.  I am guessing that this is the reason.  It is the width more than the thickness that is the problem.I am bummed because I like the watch otherwise!Update 10/28/2013I still like this but there are more annoying features1.  Options are unnecessarily limited.  In particular, it would be great to modify the vibrate with regard to number of vibrations and duration. Augmented Smartwatch pro lets you do this but it is expensive and not so easy.  I would love to modify how long an alert stays on the screen.. and modify font size so I could see them!  I would also like to modify the order of the apps on the phone.  You can change them but it isn't very flexible...and there are no directions for doing it.2.  Unless you get to your alert quickly (and you can't modify how long the alert stays on), you have to push the button on the side, Then the home button, THEN the app button. THREE PUSHES??  This makes absolutely no sense.  You should be able to hit one thing, be it the screen or the side button and the last alert should be on the screen.  Again, this could be an option.I am hoping so badly that third party people come up with things that fix these obvious deficiencies.  The apps are limited though.Update 11/4/13Incredibly, the bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch interferes with the bluetooth connection between the car and the phone.  When I receive a call in the car, the voice of the caller is garbled.  The phone is transmitting to the watch because the caller id is on the watch screen.  Turning off the watch doesn't help (because the phone is still transmitting to it).  This is a major issue for me.  I am hoping there will be a solution.  I am aware that some others are having this issue and some are not having this issue.",

Base SW2 app offering includes integration with 'Runtastic' - great app!Only thing that Sony still needs to work out is the Email smart extension app - currently does not sync with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) running on Android device.

And unlike Pebble and Samsung, this is Sony's third edition in this category and they have had time to refine and improve upon their previous iterations.A little back history on myself.  As far as watches are concerned, I have owned many of the Casio data watches and even Microsoft's bulky attempt to create a data watch so I have plenty of experience of using watches for  more than just reading the time.  I purchased the previous version of the Sony Smart Watch after waiting for an opportunity to own a Pebble watch, even pre-ordering it.  I canceled my order when they emailed me and just said to go pick it up at Best Buy.  This left a bad taste in my mouth and decided to give the far cheaper Sony Smart Watch a try.  Surprisingly, even with its deficiencies, I found it very useful and many people liked the charming little square on my wrist.  Yes, you could not read it in direct sunlight, yes it disconnected and could be difficult re-pair, but all-in-all I really liked it.Then six months back when Sony announced the Smart Watch 2, and how they had addressed all the cons of the previous version, it was a no-brainer and immediately ordered one from a non-prime seller two weeks ago.  Last week it arrived and my feelings are that Sony has addressed many, if not all of the weaknesses in the previous version and if it hasn't made clear, the trans-reflective LCD panel actually becomes more readable with more direct light.  And this is not only with the clock face, but any message that appears on the face.  If you don't realize the potential of just this option alone, imagine being outdoors working on something and just rotating your wrist slightly to see very clear text message, email, whatever.  This alone was worth the $130 upgrade price over the previous model.Power for me has been a mixed. I receive notifications for six email accounts, as well as SMS, CIDs, task and calendar events, so my watch is constantly going off.  If you keep the standard brightness level and change the watch face to white, I could not last out the day.  I have since reversed the watch face and lowered the brightness and when I charge at night, I am still at 70-80%.  On that note, the power level indicator is true battery level similar to your phone, so it is easy to see at what level your battery is. It also alerts you to a low battery level, maybe to an annoying amount, so you can't blame Sony if you don't charge it.  Finally, I give credit to the genius engineer who decided to put a micro-USB connector.  Now I can charge it anywhere and no longer have to play the charger contact point game as I did in the previous version to make sure it is charging.Okay, now for the quarks.  It still disconnects and reconnects, but all my BT devices do, and this is the case with many of my Android devices so I won't blame Sony for this one. For the person who felt the BT interfered with their BT speakerphone, I have had no problem with the five speaker/ear piece type devices, so it maybe just his BT device.  I use Samsung and Jawbones and few unknown brands without a problem other than a quick disconnect or two.  One other quark and that is with the watch face.  For some reason the time will freeze, or more likely the watch face is not updating and the time will be few minutes to a half hour off.  This is caused some strange looks from others who think I have lost it or my watch is broken.  If I press the status button and the home button I can see the true time in the top right hand corner, which is correct -- strange.  One other thing, you know longer lose the ability to tell time if you lose or turn of your phones BT so it still functions as, who would have guessed an actual time telling watch.Good job Sony.  I had faith in your ability to still crank out great tech and finally get it that you can make more money opening devices to a common standard so that I could use it with my Samsung S4 -- something that the Samsung Gear can't do.",

The only things I would like to see added in future updates are the ability to disable the vibrate when connecting and disconnecting, as that gets EXTREMELY annoying, and the addition of a number of additional watch faces.

Like someone else said it won't change your life but at times it can be quite handy. The other day at the rec. center, for example, I had my phone in a locker and as long as I was in sight of the phone, I could read emails and messages, and control my music all from my watch. December 5, Sony updated the phone so now there are several more watch faces to choose from, you can read the entire email or message, and several other nice changes which means Sony is supporting the device. All in all I'm happy I got the Sony instead of the Galaxy Gear which I originally was going to get.Update... December 14,2013.Just got another update for the watch. That's two in two weeks! It looks like Sony is really trying. Also, I noticed if I turn off my NFC setting on my phone (Galaxy s4),I seem to get better battery life. Still like the watch.",

When I finally decided to use the instructions, it seemed simple enough but i unfortunately had to turn the thing off and on repeatedly since it would freeze up during this process. Now that its finally working, i appreciate the simplicity but would have loved to have more watch faces to choose from.

B00FB2XNCE,5,1,1,"January 9, 2014",A6AK6IDS5T500,Using with the Note3.,"It's a neat gadget, not 100% necessary really,  but it keeps me up to date on my email, my rss feeds and who's calling me or texting. I also check the weather frequently with it. It's fully waterproof, to a certain depth of course. The battery lasts me about 4 days if i disable bluetooth on the watch when I go to bed. Pairing is simple. I had to purchase a black leather wrist strap because the cheap rubber one included shredded when I got the watch caught on the dish washer edge. Bluetooth 4.0 on the phone end seems to be more battery efficient, and I see no drain whatsoever due to the watch. Going from 99% to 96% after 6 hours of not using the phone and getting loads of notifications on the watch. Bluetooth 3.0 on the other hand drains the phone rapidly. On my LG l9 I couldn't make 4 hours without the phone going dead with a full charge starting out. I can also control the music player and camera through the watch, as well as all my toggles like wifi and gps. Can also see phone battery life through that watch app; commander. It charges extremely fast on my 2.1A charger. I get a lot of compliments on it, any many people confuse it with the galaxy gear, but i show them the benefits of Sony by dumping some of my omnipresent water bottle over it and proceeding to use it. Who needs to talk on their watch or take pictures when the phone is much better at those things. Also the gear is twice the price and much bulkier and awful 4 hour battery life on it compared to this 4 days. The apps for this are growing,  as it's open source and the only thing I'm missing is Google maps gps directions possibly showing up on the watch. That'd be nice. But fantastic product, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it a second time around",

I bought this for a friend and after one wear the strap broke. I contacted the seller and was instructed to call Sony.  I did not want to return the watch just wanted to exchange it for one that was not defective.  My friend loves the watch but is unable to wear it. $169 gone down the drain. I wish I could have gotten this resolved.,

Why on earth spend $200.00 on a product that the manufacturer won't stand behind for at least a year.  Would really like to know if anyone else had this problem.,
B00FB2XNCE,3,1,1,"January 6, 2014",A1JNF8SXXNKSIJ,Not well designed interface and poor application selection,Pros: It has a very nice design to look at. It fits well and is lighter than a normal watch. Also it does cost less then the Galaxy GearCons: The built in music controls are horrible even with non-sony applications. Have no significant ability to respond to texts or email. At least the GGear lets you use your voice for basic responses not just pre-made text.

B00FB2XNCE,4,1,1,"May 28, 2014",A1CSOOLZWUWB57,It's alright,"Pros:It's stylish, durable, and works well for what it does. It can be cleaned off pretty easily too by just running it under water and drying it.Battery life is pretty good when not connected to a device (can't speak for how well it is when connected to another device).Cons:The silicon straps seem to attract a good bit of dust and dirt.Other Thoughts:This watch was a bit uncomfortable to sleep with a few times, but most of the time it's fine.The vibration is really loud if you have the watch laying on a hard surface (especially metal).This watch requires two Android applications for functionality. One is the LiveWare Manager, and the second is the SW2 app. The latter doesn't run on non-ICS+ devices, nor is it even visible from Play Store on unsupported devices (this confused me for a good bit as to why I couldn't proceed in the LiveWare setup).Speaking of apps, Sony only has a few (around 5 or so) apps for the SW2. The &#34;hundreds&#34; come from other developers though. Majority of these apps also cost money (between $1-2 average). So essentially, if you want more functionality out of your watch than what it offers, you may either need to shell out some money, or develop some apps yourself (there is a free SDK available from Sony).I figured the flashlight app on the watch to be a bit of a gimmick, but I was able to use it successfully a few times. Pretty awesome :)With Bluetooth disabled on the watch, battery life is pretty great. It's been close to a week since I last fully charged, and I have around 15% battery left. I've used the flashlight a few times, and use the watch every now and then daily, including a daily alarm notification.I wish the watch would be able to communicate with a computer (or any other internet and bluetooth-enabled device). Would be cool to be able to have my watch connected to my laptop, and it go off when I get a new email or something through Google Chrome. If I understand right, the closest you can come with syncing the watch with a computer is to use Android-x86, since no (current) Android emulator supports hardware Bluetooth, but I can't say if both required apps (LiveMgr + SW2) run or not in such an environment.If the SW2 was able to interact with other native applications on other devices, this would be a pretty awesome watch, but sadly it is only limited to Android (4.0+) devices currently. Maybe this will change in the future.",

Good looking, but doesn't work with the Mega until the OS is updated to 4.4 KitKat - when is that I asked Samsung? They have no idea. So, returned that one (love Amazon's return policy). I heard good things about the Pebble, so tried it next - wow, not sure why anyone likes it - boring, no color, very limited - no interest in keeping it, so returned it and decided to give the SW2 a shot and see if I liked it - if not, I was stuck waiting on the Mega upgrade. This watch is GREAT!I had to get a third party email - (Mail notification by Sascha Loffler) - which works perfectly. I also got WatchFaces by NeFa and love the Simple Style Design 1, which you can personalize to remove things you don't want. Used NFC to pair, no problems at all.

B00FB2XNCE,4,6,7,"January 21, 2014",A2507ZYWGMY9BK,Good notification device,"The typical way to check a notification on your phone is to pull it out of your pocket, hit the power button, swipe to unlock, and swipe to see the notifications. There are many situations where going through this process is rude, dangerous, and/or difficult such as driving a car, riding a bike, doing construction work, sitting in a meeting, carrying a bag of groceries, holding your child's hand, etc. If you get tens to hundreds of notifications throughout the day, having a notification device on your wrist can be a huge benefit.I've been using the Sony Smartwatch2 for a couple months and it generally does the job well. Notifications and phone calls display automatically on the watch face without requiring the push of any buttons. About 10-20 words can be displayed on the watch which is generally enough to tell if you want to deal with it now or later. You can even read an entire email on the watch without a button press by just swiping up.The Smartwatch2 is very limited in terms of customization or settings. While more flexibility would be nice, it is not a huge deal to me because I just want the watch to do its job as a notifier and not try to be a mini-Android device. I purposely keep my watch bare-bones as far as apps so as to not cause any problems. Certain apps like the calendar app are buggy anyway.One of the best features is that it charges via universal micro-USB. If you are considering a smartwatch, you likely already have micro-USB chargers all over the place. The battery life is pretty good. If you turn off your watch at night, it will last a few days between charges.Another nice feature is the non-proprietary watchband which can accept any 24mm generic band. This allows easy customization or replacement of a broken band.There are some negatives with this watch which can be annoying:*The range of this watch could be a lot better. The watch needs to be within about 20 feet from your phone. This is a Bluetooth limitation so it's not really the phone's fault. The lack of range means that if you are walking around your house without the phone in your pocket, you will be going in and out of range all the time. Every time you go in or out of range, the watch vibrates. This gets annoying fast and will cause you to think you are getting notifications when you are not.If you are right around the outer limits of the range, the Smartwatch2 may vibrate constantly as it pairs and un-pairs every few seconds. This happens to me all the time when I'm sitting on my couch watching TV and my phone is in an adjacent room. There is no way to turn off this vibration notification as far as I know. (Note: This issue has been resolved with an update.)I hope future generations of the watch can connect to my home network so I can get notifications anywhere in my house.*There is no way to tell if your Smartwatch2 is actively paired or not. A small LED on the outside of the watch to signal the pairing status would be a great help.I researched other smartwatch options prior to purchase but felt the Sony version suited me the best. The Galaxy Gear and the Pebble use a proprietary charger which is a huge negative. The Galaxy Gear is more expensive, not as universally compatible, and has much less battery life.Overall, the Sony Smartwatch2 works well as a pure notification device. It does its job effortlessly and reliably (as long your phone is in range), and the battery doesn't require frequent recharging. As long as you aren't expecting much more than that, you will be happy.UPDATE: I would strongly recommend the 'Find Phone' app which allows you to locate your phone even if it is on silent mode.UPDATE April 2014: A new software update allows you to disable the connected/disconnected vibration notification. The watchface is also more customizable. Both good upgrades.",

I agree, it does seem very fragile. Quit being cheap Sony and bundle this baby with a decent watch strap!Why did I choose this watch over its competitors?Unlike the Galaxy Gear by Samsung, the Sony Smart Watch 2 battery lasts longer, about 4 days per charge of average use versus 48 hours as many report with the Galaxy Gear. The Sony is weather/water/dust resistant according to IP57 standards. So I could get away with wearing this watch in the shower, outdoors in crazy weather, and the occasional splash of water whilst the washing of my hands.Additionally, the Sony Smart Watch 2 has a 'Low-Power' reflective display that enables the device to always show the current time and day-date on the watch face at a glance whether on your wrist or the table. The Galaxy Gear has to powered on by a defined motion or the pressing of the watches button.I honestly like being able to glance down quickly at my wrist and see the time versus doing anything else to produce the display to show me what day and time it is. This feature of the Sony is simply genius and executed beautifully and legible even in the lowest of ambient light. When it gets pitch black dark, simply press the button on the Sony's side and the display is illuminated.Water & weather resistance, a longer battery life, and the ability read the watch face at a glance without needing any additional input is why I chose the SW2 over Galaxy Gear. Albeit Sony's watch has a lower-res display and you cannot place or take calls via the watch itself. I found myself entering predefined text message replies so I could at least respond to incoming texts. There is no on-screen keyboard provided by Sony's apps. There are some that you can purchase by developers in the Google Play market.Pebble smart watch just looks like an etch-a-sketch with an ugly and bulky fascia. Perhaps the Pebble Steel will fancy it up a notch, well the fascia anyway. I like a screen, a coloured screen. I am biased as I purely discredited the Pebble for it's e-paper ink display type. The cool feature I like of the new Pebble Steel is a built in status LED that can notify you of missed calls, emails, and messages.I use this watch with my Samsung Note 3. It is awkward because you have to download apps within the app for apps on the watch. You download an app that is made by Sony that syncs the Apps to your watch via bluetooth and also handles any firmware updates to the watch itself. The Gmail app keeps crashing on my Galaxy Note 3 and tends to bug out on the phone as well.Sony just pushed it's Smart Watch 3 blueprints through to the FCC. Expect a new Sony Smart Watch 3 in the coming weeks or months. Additionally the new Galaxy Gear 2 will be out. Here we go again!Personally, I am going to wait and see what else is brought to the table, that is unless I can score the Sony, Pebble, or Galaxy older models at a price under $100.Any questions or comments, post away I'll be more than happy to help.",
B00FB2XNCE,5,5,5,"April 23, 2014",A3G2W9T21IL0VW,Best Smartwatch For The Money,"Considering cost versus features, this is currently the best smartwatch on the market.  SImilar technology to the Qualcomm Toq in terms of the display and $100 less. New update gives the option of customizable watch faces with hundreds of apps in the play store. Better build quality that the Pebble.  There are reviews about the watch itself popping out of the frame but those were just a few reviews versus many other reviews that did not mention that. Time will tell what will happen, only had the watch a couple of days.There is another review about the smartwatch not having any indication when the watch loses connectivity to the phone.  With the new customizable watch faces, there is a bluetooth widget.  Also in the weather app, there is also a weather widget.  These widgets, when used with the customizable watchface, goes dark when there is no connection. Not completely out, but darker than the other widgets.  The watch also vibrates when there is no connection.All in all, this seems to be a very good product.  I currently have the Sony smartwatch 1 and the Metawatch Strata.

The manufacturer sent the incorrect product at first and it took about a week to correct it. They were very responsive and got the item to me before the holiday.,
B00FB2XNCE,2,1,1,"April 20, 2014",A15UJQ471739PI,Not nearly as good as portrayed in reviews,"This weekend I explored the Sony SW2 as well as the Pebble. I returned both.To me, the whole play with the present smartwatch options is in the notifications. I love the idea of being able to check my messages in a meeting without pulling out my phone.  The problem is that neither watch could forward my work related emails.  The SW2 works great with gmail and texts, but it cannot communicate with my Exchange server from work. It's not clear why it should need to (shouldn't it just mirror the notifications via Bluetooth), but the official Mail app only works with imap and POP3.The rest of the watch is okay.  It took me about an hour to get it set up (there are no meaningful instructions).  It also caused my phone to glitch out repeatedly during set up, which made very tedious to locate and download the dozen or so required apps.  Once it was set, some apps worked better than others. The music app, which is supposed to allow you to control the music player on your phone, worked about half the time. The interface and instructions are terrible. The slideshow app is cool.  It allows you to view recent photos from the camera phone.The SW2 also allows limited opportunities to respond to messages and emails. You can also decline phone calls with a short text message. That's all good, but it's not a major improvement over picking up the phone.A few other annoyances: The watch comes with a huge metal band with no instructions as to how to make it smaller. Even after you figure it out, you need special jeweler's tools to do it.The most annoying thing is the absurd power cord.  First, no charger, just a USB cable. Even worse, the cord is about 4 inches long.  The only way to use it is to plug into a laptop. It's too short to plug into a standard wall outlet -- the cord won't reach the  ground!  (Even if it did reach, do I really have to put my fancy smartwatch on the floor every night?). What a hassle to have to charge the watch every night without a convenient way to plug it in.Overall, it's a fairly attractive product with good potential, but definitely not ready for primetime.  The apps are too buggy, the software made my phone sad, and the accessories are woeful. Worst of all, it doesn't do the one thing I need it to do. So what's the point for $200?",
B00FB2XNCE,3,1,1,"April 20, 2014",A06913942TXRX9PB0CGYT,Great watch but...,I bought this watch last year in November. I only use it once a week but today i noticed the backside of the watch just collapsed inside the watch. I don't know how the watch still works.I can even see the glue that was used in the watch.I don't know why this happened. I don't use the watch for outdoor/indoor sports. I only use it as a regular watch when I go to a restaurant or  elegant place.,

The only small inconvenience is that I ordered the watch with rubber bracelet because I'm allergic to metal. the bracelet I recieved is metal so I can't use the watch as I would like!!",
